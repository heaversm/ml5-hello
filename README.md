### Summary

Machine Learning is rapidly being implemented in all facets of life to parse data, learn from that data, and draw conclusions based on what it has learned. Inherent in this is the fact that machines see the world very differently than we do.  In assigning creative tasks to machines such as drawing pictures, making music, and creating written language, we expose these differences in strange and unexpected ways. 

This class will look at how to leverage various Machine Learning frameworks to generate art, music, and written language that belongs not fully to the human world or the computational one.

Machine Learning is not for the faint of heart - it can often involve a number of dependencies to install, models can be slow to train and processor intensive, and results unpredictable. But in that unpredictability lies the creativity! 

While we we will be examining some of the most beginner friendly machine learning tools, you will be expected to install some software, look at some code, and run some computations outside of class. But donâ€™t fear, we will arrive at some interesting results together regardless of whether you are an absolute beginner or have done some coding / machine learning in the past.
