NUNKIE
                              (Laughs sheepishly--puts money
                              down--TUSH HAWG pushes stack of chips
                              toward him. Bus.)
I didn't put it down because I knew you all goin' to be puttin' it right

                              poker. The game gets tense. SACK
                              DADDY is first man at TUSH's left--he
                              throws back three cards and is dealt

AUNT DILSEY
                              (Enters through portieres--stands and
                              looks disapprovingly)
You all oughter be ashamed of yourself, gamblin' and carryin' on like
this!

BLACK BABY
Aw, this ain't no harm, Aunt Dilsey! You go on back to bed and git your
night's rest.

AUNT DILSEY
No harm! I know all about these no-harm sins! If you don't stop this
card playin', all of you all goin' to die and go to Hell.
                              (Shakes warning finger--exits through
                              portieres--while she is talking the
                              men have been hiding cards out of
                              their hands and pulling aces out of
                              sleeves and vest pockets and
                              shoes--it is done quickly, one does
                              not see the other do it)

NUNKIE
                              (Shoving a chip forward)
A dollar!

SACK DADDY
Raise you two!

BLACK BABY
I don't like to strain with nobody but it's goin' to cost you five. Come
on, you shag-nags! This hand I got is enough to pull a country man into
town. *[Handwritten: Last sentence crossed through in pencil.]

TOO-SWEET
You all act like you're spuddin'! Bet some money! Put your money where

TUSH HAWG
Twenty-five dollars to keep my company! Dog-gone, I'm spreadin' my
knots!

SACK DADDY
And I bet you a fat man I'll take your money--I call you.
                              (Turns up his cards--he has four aces
                              and king)

TUSH HAWG
                              (showing his cards)
Youse a liar! I ain't dealt you no aces. Don't try to carry the Pam-Pam
to me 'cause I'll gently chain-gang for you!

SACK DADDY
Oh yeah! I ain't goin' to fit no jail for you and nobody else. I'm to
get me a green club and season it over your head. Then I'll give my case
to Miss Bush and let Mother Green stand my bond! I got deal them aces!

NUNKIE
That's a lie! Both of you is lyin'! Lyin' like the cross-ties from New
York to Key West! How can you all hold aces when I got four? Somebody is
goin' to West hell before midnight!

BECKERWOOD
Don't you woof at Tush Hawg. If you do I'm goin' to bust hell wide open
with a man!

BLACK BABY
                              (Pulls out razor--Bus.)
My chop-axe tells me I got the only clean aces they is on this table!
Before I'll leave you all rob me outa my money, I'm goin' to die it off!

TOO-SWEET
I promised the devil one man and I'm goin' to give him five!
                              (Draws gun)

TUSH HAWG
Don't draw your bosom on me! God sent me a pistol and I'm goin' to send
him a man!
                              (FIRES. Bus. for all)

AUNT DILSEY
                              (Enters after shooting bus. Stands.
                              Bus. drops to chair)
They wouldn't lissen--
                              (Looks men over--Bus.)

And I'm gointer be de hawk. Lemme git myself a stick to mark wid. (The
curtain rises slowly. As it goes up the game is being organized. The
boy who is the hawk is squatting center stage in the street before the
store with a short twig in his hand. The largest girl is lining up the
other children behind her.)

You shan't have a chick.

HAWK

HEN
There's de road.

HAWK
I'm comin' back.

(During this dialog the hawk is feinting and darting in his efforts to
catch a chicken and the chickens are dancing defensively.)

HEN
Don't keer if you do.

HAWK
My pot's a boiling.

(Hawk darts quickly around the hen and grabs a chicken and leads him
off and places the captive on his knees at the store porch. After a
brief bit of dancing he catches another, then a third who is a chubby
little boy. The little boy begins to cry.)

LITTLE BOY

captives. Hawk returns to game.)

HAWK

VOICE FROM A DISTANCE
Titter! You Titter!!!

BIG GIRL
Yessum

VOICE
If you don't come here wid dat soap you better!

BIG GIRL
(shakes herself poutingly, half sobs) Soon's I git grown I'm gointer
run away. Everytime a person gits to havin' fun, it's "come here,
Titter and rake de yard." She don't never make Bubber do nothin. (She
exits into the store.)

HAWK
Now we ain't got no hen.

ALL THE GIRLS
(in a clamor) I'll be de mama hen! Lemme be it! (Enter Hambo left and
stands looking at the children.)

HAMBO
Can't dese young uns keep up a powerful racket, Joe?

LINDSAY
They sho kin. They kin git round so vi'grous when they whoopin and
hollerin and rompin and racin, but just put 'em to work now and you
kin count dead lice fallin' off of 'em.

(Enter Tillie from the store with the soap. Hambo pulls out a plug of
tobacco from his hip pocket and bites a chunk from it.)

HAMBO
De way dese chillun is dese days is,--eat? Yes! Squall and holler?
Yes! Kick out shoes? Yes! Work? No!!

LINDSAY
You sho is tellin' de truth. Now look at dese! I'll bet everyone of
'em's mammies sent 'em to de store an' they out here frollickin'. If
one of 'em was mine, I'd whup 'em till they couldn't set down. (to the
children) Shet up dat racket and gwan home! (The children pay no
attention and the game gets hotter.)

DISTANT VOICE
(off stage) You Tit-ter!! You Tit-Ter!!

WALTER
Titter, don't you hear yo' ma callin' you?

ESSIE
Yessuh, I mean naw suh.

LINDSAY
How come you can't answer, then? Lawd knows de folks just ruins
chilluns dese days. Deys skeered tuh whup 'em right. Den before they
gits twenty de gals done come up wid somethin' in dey arms an' de boys
on de chain gang. If you don't whup 'em, they'll whip you.

HAMBO
Dat sho is whut de Lawd loves. When I wuz a boy they _raised_ chillen
then. Now they lets 'em do as they please. There ain't no real
chestizing no more. They takes a lil tee-ninchy switch and tickles em.
No wonder de world is in sich uh mess.

VOICE OFF STAGE
You Tit-ter!! Aw Titter!!

ESSIE
(stops to listen) Yessum!!

VOICE OFF STAGE
If you don't come here, you better!

ESSIE
Yessum! (to her playmates) Aw shucks! I got to go home. (She exits
right, walking sullenly. The game has stopped.)

LINDSAY
(pointing at Essie) You see dat gal shakin' herself at her mammy? De
sassy lil binch needs her guts stomped out. (to Essie) Run! I'm comin'
on down there an' tell yo' ma how 'omanish you is, shakin' yo'self at
grown folks. (Essie walks slower and shakes her skirt contemptously.
Lindsay jumps to his feet as if to pursue her.) You must smell
yo'self! (Essie exits.) Now de rest of you haitians scatter way from
in front dis store. Dis ain't no place for chillen, nohow. (gesture of
shooing) Gwan! Thin out! Every time a grownperson open they mouf y'all
right dere to gaze down they throat. Git! (The children exit sullenly
right. In the silence that follows the cracking of Walter's peanut
shells can be heard very plainly.)

HAMBO
Walter, God a' mighty! You better quit eatin' em ground peas de way
you do. You gointer die wid de colic.

LINDSAY
Aw, taint gointer hurt him. I don't b'lieve uh cord uh wood would lay
heavy on Walter's belly. He kin eat mo' penders than Brazzle's mule.

WALTER
(laughing) Aw naw, don't throw me in wid dat mule. He could eat up
camp-meetin, back off scociation and drink Jurdan dry.

LINDSAY
And still stay so po' till he wuzn't nothin atall but a mule frame.
(Enter Lige Moseley right) Taint never been no mule in de world lak
dat ole yaller mule since Jonah went to joppy.

(Lige seats himself on the floor on the other side of the steps. Pulls
out a bone toothpick and begins to pick his teeth)

LIGE
Y'all still talkin bout Brazzle's ole useter-be mule?

HAMBO
Yeah. Memeber dat time Brazzle hitched him to de plow and took him to
Eshleman's new ground?

LIGE
And he laid down before he'd plow a lick. Sho I do! But who ever seen
him work? All you ever did see was him and Brazzle fightin up and down
de furrows. (all laugh) He was so mean he would even try to kick you
if you went in his stall to carry him some corn.

WALTER
Nothin but pure concentrated meanness stuffed into uh mule hide. Thass
de reason he wouldn't git fat--just too mean.

LIGE
Sho was skinny now. You could use his ribs for a washboard and hang de
clothes up on his hips to dry. (all laugh)

HAMBO
Lige, you kin lie [Note: "like" crossed out] lak cross ties [Note
inserted text: from Jacksonville to Key West.]. But layin all sides to
jokes, when they told me dat mule was dead, uh just took and knocked
off from work to see him drug out lak all de rest of de folks, and
folkses dat mule wuz too contrary to lay down on his side and die. He
laid on his raw-boney back wid his foots stickin straight up in de air
lak he wuz fightin something.

LINDSAY
He wuz--bet he fought ole death lak a natural man. Ah seen his bones
yistiddy, out dere on de edge of de cypress swamp. De buzzards done
picked em clean and de elements done bleached em.

LIGE
Everybody went to dat draggin out. Even Joe Clarke shet up his store
dat mornin and went (turns his head and calls into the store) didn't
you, Mr. Clarke?

CLARKE'S VOICE
Didn't I whut? (enters and stands in door)

LIGE
Shet up yo' store and go to de draggin out of Brazzle's ole mule.

CLARKE
I, God, Yeah. It was worth it. (sees Hambo) I didn't know you was out

HAMBO
Lissen at de ole tush hawg! Well, go git de board, and lemme beat you

(to men on porch) You got to talk to wimmen-folks lak dat--tell 'em
every lil' thing-do she'd come rackin out here wid de board by itself.

(Enter Mrs. Clarke with homemade checker-board and coffee can
containing the much-used checkers. Clarke sits on a keg and faces
Hambo. They put the board on their knees and pour out the checkers)

HAMBO
You want black or red?

CLARKE
Oh, I don't keer which--I'm gointer beat you anyhow. You take de
black. (they arrange them. The others get near to look on. Hambo sits
looking at the board without moving.)

HAMBO
Who's first move?

CLARKE
Black folks always go to work first. Move! (Hambo moves and the same
proceeds with the spectators very interested. Enter Lum Boger [Note:
Handwritten correction: Bailey] right and joins the spectators. A
woman enters left with a market basket and goes on in the store. The
checkers click on the board. A girl about twelve enters right and goes
into the store and comes out with a stick of peppermint candy.

WALTER
Naw you don't Hambo!--Don't you go in dere! Dats a trap--(pointing)
come right here and you got him.

LIGE
Back dat man up (pointing) Hambo do he'll git et up.

(there is the noise of the checkers for a half minute then a general
shout of triumph)

SPECTATORS
You got him now, Hambo! Clarke, he's sho got you.

CLARKE
(Chagrined) Aw, he aint done nothin! Jes' watch ME.

HAMBO
(Jeering) Yeah, gwan move! Ha! Ha! go head and move.

SPECTATORS
Aw, he got you, Bro. Mayor--might as well give up. He got you in de
Louisville loop.

CLARKE
Give up what? He can't beat me? (peeved) de rest of y'all git from
over me, whoopin and hollerin! I God, a man can't hear his ears.

(The men fall back revealing the players clearly)

HAMBO
Aw, neb mind bout them, Joe, go head and move. You aint got but one
move to make nohow--go head on and take it.

CLARKE
(moving a checker) Aw, here.

HAMBO
(triumphant) Now! watch me boys whut Ahm gonna do to him. Ahm gonna
laff in notes, while Ah work on him. (he lifts a checker high in the
air preparatory to the jump, laughing to the scale and counting each
checker he jumps out loud) Do, sol, fa, me, la! One! (jumps a checker)
la, sol, fa, me, do! Two! (jumps another) Do, re, fa, me, do, Three!
Me, re, la, so, fa! Four! (the crowd is roaring with laughter) Sol,
fa, me, la, sol, do! Five! Ha! Ha! boys I got [Note: "the" x-ed out]
de ole tush hawg! I got him in de go-long. (He slaps his leg and
accidently knocks the board off his knee and spills the checkers.)

CLARKE
Too bad you done dat, Hambo, cause Ah was gointer beat you at dat (he
rises and starts towards the door of the store as the crowd roars in
laughter)

HAMBO
You mean you was gointer beat me to de door, not a game Of checkers.
Ah done run de ole coon in his hole.

LIGE
Well, Hambo, you done got to be so hard at checkers, come on less see
whut you can do wid de cards. (He pulls out a soiled deck from his
coat pocket and moves toward the bench at the left of the porch) You
take Lum and me and Walter will wear you out.

HAMBO
You know I don't play no cards.

LUM
We aint playin for no money, just a lil Florida flip.

HAMBO
Y'all can't play no Florida flip. 'Fore Ah joined de church there
wasn't a man in de state could beat me wid de cards. But Ahm a deacon
now, in Macedonia Baptist--Ah don't bother wid de cards no mo". (He
and Joe Lindsay go inside store)

LIGE
Well, come on Lum. Walter, git yo'self a partner.

WALTER
(Looking about) Taint nobody to git (looks off right) Here come Dave
Carter.

LIGE
You can't do nothin wid him dese days. He useter choose a game of
cards when he wasn't out huntin, but now when he ain't out huntin
varmints he's huntin' Daisy Blunt. (Enter Dave right with a shot-gun
slung over his shoulder.)

WALTER
Come on, fish, lemme bend a five-up over yo' head. You looks just like
my meat.

DAVE
Ahm on mah way to kill me a turkey gobbler, but if you and Lum thinks
y'all's tush hawgs Ah'll stop long enough to take you down a
button-hole lower. (He sets his gun down and finds a seat and draws it
up to the card table)

WALTER
Naw, Dave, we aint going to fool wid no button-holes we gointer tear
off de whole piece dat de button-holes is in. (They all get set) All
right boys, turn it on and let de bad luck happen.

LIGE
(Probbing the deck) My deal.

WALTER
Watch yo'self Dave, don't get to worryin bout Daisy and let 'em ketch
yo' jack.

LUM
(Winking) What you reckon he gointer be worryin' bout Daisy for? Dot's
Jim's gal.

DAVE
Air Lawd, a heap sees but a few knows. Deal de cards man--you
shufflin' a mighty lot.

WALTER
Sho is--must be tryin' to carry de cut to us.

LIGE
Aw, we ain't gonna cheat you, we gonna beat you. (He slams down the
cards for Dave to cut) Wanna cut 'em?

DAVE
Nope. Taint no use cuttin' a rabbit out when you kin twist him out.
Deal 'em! (Lige deals and turns up Jack of spades.)

WALTER
Yee-ee! Did you snatch dat Jack?

LIGE
Man, you know I ain't snatched no Jack. Whut you doin'?

WALTER
I'm beggin!

LIGE
Go ahead and tell 'em I sent you.

WALTER
Play just like ahm in New York, partner. (scratches his head) We
oughter try to ketch dat Jack.

LIGE
Stick out yo' hand an' you'll draw back a nub.

WALTER
Whut you want me to play for you, partner?

DAVE
Play me a baby diamond.
                   (Walter plays, then Lum, then Dave)

LUM
(Triumphant) Looka pardner, they doin all dat woofin on uh
queen--sendin' women to do uh man's work. Watch me stomp her wid mah
king (He slams his card down and collects the trick.) Now come un
under dis ace! (They all play and he collects the trick.) Now whut you
want me to play for you, pardner?

LIGE
How many times you seen de deck.

LUM
Twice

LIGE
Pull off wid yo' king.

(Lum plays the king of spades. All the others play.)
Look at ole low pardner. Ah knowed ah wuz gointer ketch him! Come
right back at 'em.

LUM
(stands up and slams down the ace) Pack up, pardner. Ahm playin' mah
knots, now all play now. Ho! Ho! Dere goes de queen'. De Jack's a
gentleman! (Lige takes the Jack and sticks it up on his forehead in
braggadocia.) Here comes de ten spot, pardner, ahm dumpin to yuh!

LIGE
(as he plays the Jack) Everybody git up off it and dump. High, low,
Jack, game and gone from de first four.

WALTER
Gimme dem cards! Y'all carried de cub to us dat time. (riffles the
cards elaborately) but de deal is in de high, tall house now. Dis is
Booker T Washington spreadin his mess. (offers cards to Lige) Cut?

LIGE
Yeah, cut 'em and shoot 'em. I'd cut behind mah ma. (He cuts and
Walter deals.)

WALTER
Well, whut sayin'?

LUM
I'm beggin.

WALTER
Get up off yo' knees. Youse dat one.

LIGE
Walter, you sho stacked dese cards.

WALTER
Aw, stop cryin' and play, man. Youse too old to be hollerin'
titty-mama.

LUM
Dis ain't no hand, dis is a foot. What you want me to play for you
partner?

LIGE
Play yo' own hand partner--I ain't nobody. Lead yo' bosses. (He leads
the ace of clubs. Play goes round to dealer and Walter takes the card
off the deck and slams it down.)

WALTER
Get up ol' deuce of diamonds and gallop off wid yo' load. Pardner, how
many times you seen de deck?

DAVE
(Two times--(they make signals.)

WALTER
Watch dis ol' queen. Less go! (He begins to sing--Dave joins in.) When
yo' card gits lucky, oh pardner, you oughter be in a rollin' game. (He
speaks.) Ha! Ha! Wash day and no soap! (He sticks the Jack upon his
forehead. He stands up and sings again.) Ahm goin' to de 'Bama Lawd.
Pardner don't want no change. (He collects that trick and plays again.
Dave also stands.)

DAVE
Here come de man from de White House--ol' king of diamonds. (Sings,
all join.) Ahm goin' back to de Bama, Lawd. Pardner won't be worried
wid you. (He collects the trick.) Never had no trouble, Lour pardner,
till I stopped by here.

(They all stand hilariously slam down their cards.

WALTER
Aw, wese just too hard for you boys--we eats our dinner out de
blacksmith shop. Y'all can't bully dis game. (He solemnly reaches over
and takes Dave's hand.)

DAVE
(to Walter) Mr. Hoover, you sho is a noble president. We done stuck
dese shad-moufs full of cobs. They skeered to play us any mo'.

LIGE
Who skeered? Y'all jus' playin ketch up nohow. Git back down and lemme
wrap uh five-up round yo' neck.

DAVE
(looking off right) Squat dat rabbit an' less jump another one. Here
come Daisy.

WALTER
Aw Lord, you ain't no mo' good now. But Ah don't blame you, Dave, she
looks warm.

(Enter Daisy right with a scarlet hibiscus over each ear and smiling
broadly.)

LIGE
(jumps down and takes Daisy by the arm) Come on up here, Daisy and
ease Dave's pain. He's so crazy 'bout you his heart 'bout to burn a
hole in his shirt. (She steps up on the porch)

DAVE
(Bashfully) Aw, y'all gwan. Ah kin talk.

DAISY
(Arms akimbo, impudently) Oh kin you? (She gets up close to Dave)

DAVE
(Pleased) You better git way from me fore Jim come long.

DAISY
(Coquettishly) Ain't you man enough to cover de ground you stand
on?

DAVE
Oh, Ah can back my crap! Don't worry 'bout me. Where you headed for?

DAISY
Where _you_ goin? (Audaciously)

DAVE
Out by de cypress swamp to kill us uh turkey. Its uh great big ole
gobbler--been slurring me fer six months. Ahm gointer git him today
for you, and yo' mama gointer cook him.

DAISY
Ah sho would love the ham of turkey.

DAVE
(Patting his gun barrel) Well me an' ole Hannah sho gointer git you

DAISY
I jus love goobers

DAVE
(Sticking out his right elbow) You lak chicken?

DAISY
Yeah

DAVE
Take uh wing. (She locks arms with him and they strut inside the
store.)

LIGE
Ah blieve dat fool is got some gumption. Jim Weston better watch out.

WALTER
Oh I ain't never figgered Dave was no fool. He's uh bottom fish. Jim
talks all de time but Dave will run him uh hot--here he come now.
(Looks off left. All look the same way.)

LUM
Lawd, don't he look mean? (She chuckles) Ah bet he know Daisy's here
wid Dave. Ah wouldn't take nothin' for dis.

(Enter Jim Weston left with a guitar looking very glum. He stops
beside the step for a moment. Takes off his hat and fans with it.)

JIM
Howdy do, folks.

ALL
Howdy do, Jim.

JIM
Don't do all they say. (He sees the gun leaning against the rail) Who
gun dat? (Points at the gun)

LIGE
You know so well whose gun dat is. Ah jus' heard him say he's goin out
to git his gal uh ham of a turkey gobbler out round de cypress swamp.
He's inside now treatin her to penders and candy. (He winks at the
others and they wink back)

WALTER
(Turns and calls into the store) Say, Dave! Don't try to keep Daisy in
dere all day. Her feller out here waitin to scorch her home.

DAVE (from inside store)
Let him come git her if she want him.

LIGE
Umph! dere now, de mule done kicked Rucker! (Calls inside to Dave) I
hear you crowin, rooster. I know yo' nest aint far.

HAMBO
(From inside store) Yeah, dis rooster must know something--he's gittin
plenty grit in his craw.

(General laughter)

(There is a gay burst of laughter from inside the store. In a moment
Dave enters from the store with Daisy on his left arm. With his right
he is stuffing shells into his pocket. The air is tense. Lindsay,
Hambo and Joe Clarke all enter behind the couple)

DAVE
(Releases Daisy and steps to the edge of the porch right in front of
Jim and looks up at the sky) Well, sun's gettin low--better git on out
to de swamp and git dat gobbler. (He turns and picks up de gun and
breaks it)

JIM
Lo Daisy. (Sullenly)

DAISY
(Brightly) Hello Jimmy (She is eating peanuts) Ain't Dave smart? He's
gonna kill me uh turkey an' ah kin eat all ah wants.

JIM
He aint de onliest person kin shoot round here.

LIGE
Yeah, but he's best marksman just de same. Taint no use talkin, Jim.
You can't buck Dave in de woods. But you got de world beat wid uh
git-fiddle. Yessuh, Dave is uh sworn marksman but you kin really beat
de box. Less have uh tune.

JIM
Oh I ain't for pickin no box. I come to git some shells for my rifle.
Sorta figgered on uh wild turkey or two. (He comes up on the porch and
starts in the store)

DAISY
If Dave go git me dat big ole turkey an' you go git me one too--gee!
Wont I have uh turkey fit?

LINDSAY
Lord, Daisy, you gointer have dese boys killin up every turkey in
Orange County.

WALTER
You mean _Dave_. Jim couldn't hit de side of uh barn wid uh brass
fiddle.

JIM
(Hitching up his trousers) Who can't shoot? (to Clarke) Come on an'
gimme un box uh shells. I'll show yuh who kin shoot! (He exits into
store with Clarke behind him)

DAVE
(To Daisy) You wait here till ah git back wid yo' turkey.

DAISY
Ahm skeered.

DAVE
Whut you skeered of? Jim? He aint no booger boo, if his ears do flop
lak uh mule.

DAISY
Naw. Ah aint skeered uh no Jim. Ah got tuh git back tuh de white folks
an Ahm skeered tuh go round dat lake at night by myself. (Enter Jim
from store and stands in door with box of shells in his hand)

JIM
No girl look like you don't have to go home by yo' self, if it was
midnight.

DAVE
(Gun in hand and ready to exit) Naw, cause Ahm right here--

JIM
Daisy don't you trust yo'self round dat lake after dark, wid dat
(points at Dave) breath and--britches. You needs uh real man to
perteck you from dem 'gators and moccasins.

DAVE
Let somethin happen and she'll find out who got rabbit blood and who
aint. Well, Ahm gone. (He steps down off the steps but looks back at
Daisy).

JIM
Ahm goin too--git you uh great big ole turkey-rooster. (Dave takes a
step or two towards left exit).

DAISY
Jim, aint you gointer knock off a li'l tune fo' you go? Ahm lonesome
for some music.

(Dave stops in his tracks and looks wistful. Jim sets down the shells
on the bench and picks up his box with a swagger and tunes a bit.)

WALTER
Georgy Buck!

JIM
(Plays the air thru once then starts to sing. Dave leans his gun
against the fence and stands there.)

  1.
  Georgy Buck is dead, last word he said
  I don't want no shortenin in my bread.

  2.
  Rabbit on de log--Aint got no dog
  How am I goin git him, God knows.

(Dave walks on back near the step, and begins to buck a wing. Daisy
comes down the step admiring both the playing and the dancing. All the
men goin in singing and clapping)

  3.
  Rabbit on de log--aint got no dog
  Shoot him wid my rifle, bam! bam!

  4.
  Oh Georgie Buck is dead, last word he said
  Never let a woman have her way

(The tempo rises. As Dave does a good break he brings up directly in
front of Daisy. He grabs her and swings her into a slow drag. The
porch cheers. Jim stops abruptly. (Enter two women, right and hurry up
to the porch)

1st WOMAN (LULU)
Don't stop, Jim! Hit dat box a couple mo' licks so some of dese men
kin scorch us in de store and treat us.

JIM
Aw, I dont feel lak no playin.

DAVE
(Grinning triumphantly) Ahm gone dis time to git dat turkey. Daisy run
tell yo' ma to put on de hot water kittle (He exits left with gun on
shoulder)

DAISY
Oh lemme see if I got a letter in de postoffice (She exits into store)

JIM
He better git for home fore ah bust dis box over his head.

2nd WOMAN (Jenny)
(Grabbing Lige) Aw, don't worry bout Dave Carter. Play us some music
so I kin make Lige buy me some soda water. (She is playfully dragging
Lige towards the door). Jenny you grab Walter.

(Walter makes a break to jump off the porch and run. The woman catches
him and there is a very gay bit of tussling as the men are dragged
towards the door)

1st WOMAN (Miss Lulu)
I bet if this was Daisy, they'd uh done halted inside and toted out
half de store.

JENNY
Yeah. (gets Walter to the door) Everything you hear is Daisy, Daisy,
Daisy! Just cause she got a walk on her like she done gone crazy thru
de hips! (Yanks Walter into the door) Yeah, y'all goin treat us. Come

WALTER
Yeah, but Daisy's uh young pullet and you gittin gray headed.

JENNY
Thank God I aint gray elsewhere! Come right on. You gointer buy me
some soda water nigger. (to Jim) Play us some music, Jim, so we kin
grand march up to de counter.

JIM
I can't play nothin--mad as I is. I'm one minute to boilin and two
minutes to steam. I smell blood!

MISS LULU
You don't want to fight, do you?

JIM
Sho do. You aint never seen a Weston yet dat wouldn't fight, have you?

LIGE
Thats whut they all got run outa town for--fightin. (Calls into store)
Hey, Joe, give Jenny and Lulu some soda water and ground peas on me so
they'll turn us loose. (to Jim) Yeah, y'all Westons blieves in
fightin.

JIM
Ahd ruther get run out for fightin than to be uh coward. (He slings
the guitar round his neck an' picks up his box of shells.) Well, Ah
reckon Ah'll go git Daisy her turkey cause she sho wont git none less
Ah go git it. Here come Elder Simms anyhow now taint no mo' pickin de
box. (to Daisy) Don't git lonesome whilst Ahm gone.

(Enter Daisy from the store smiling, and walks down to where Jim is
standing)

DAISY
Whuts all dis talk about fightin?

JIM
Lige throwin it up to me bout all my folks been run outa town for
fightin. But I don't keer!

DAISY
Mah mouf done got lonesome already. Buy me some chewing gum to keep
mah mouf comp'ny till y'all gits back wid dat turkey.

JIM
Don't hafta buy none. (reaches in his pocket and pulls out a stick)
What it takes tuh satisfy de ladies, Ah totes it. (He hands her the
gum tenderly) 'By, Daisy. (He walks to left exit)

DAISY
(Coyly) Bye, till you come back.

(Enter Elder Simms right)

Good evenin' everybody.

ALL
Good evenin', Elder Sims.

LUM
(Getting up from his seat on the porch) Have mah seat, Elder. Sims
takes it with a sigh of pleasure. Lum steps off the porch and sets his
hat over one eye) Say, Daisy, you aint goin to sprain yo' lil mouf on
dat tough chewin gum, is yuh? Not wid de help _you_ got. Better lemme
kinda tender dat gum up for yuh so yo' lil mouf won't hafta strain wid
it. (He places himself exactly in front of her. She glances up coyly
at him)

DAISY
Ain't you crazy, now? (Lum tries to snatch the gum but she pops it
into her mouth and laughs as he seizes her hands.

LUM
You don't need no gum to keep yo' mouf company wid me around. Ahm all
de compny yo' mouf need. Ahm sweet papa chewin and sweetness change.

DAISY
Tell dat to Bootsie Pitts, you cant fool me. (turns right) Guess Ah
better go home and see mama. Ah ain't been round since Ah come from de
white folk. You goin walk round there wid me?

LUM
Naw, Ah aint gointer _walk_. When Ahm wid de angels ah puts on mah
hosanna wings and flies round heben lak de rest. (He falls in beside
her and catches her elbow) Less go! (to the porch) See you later and
tell you straighter.

LINDSAY
Don't stay round to Daisy's too long, Lum, and get run out from under
yo' hat!

LUM
Who run?

HAMBO
Taint no use in you hollerin "who". Yo' feet don't fit no limb.
(General laughter) (Exit Lum and Daisy right)

WALTER
Lawd! Daisy sho is propaganda. She really handles a lot of traffic. Ah
don't blame de boys. If Ah was uh single man Ah'd be round there
myself.

LIGE
Ahm willin tuh serve some time on her gang as it is, but mah wife
won't lissen to reason. (Laughter) Ah tries to show her dis deep point
where taint right for one woman to be harboring uh whole man all to
herself when theres heaps uh po' young girls aint got no husband
atall. But Ah just can't sense her into it.

(Laughter)

HAMBO
Now take Jim and Dave for instant. Here they is, old friends, done
fell out and ready to fight--all over Daisy.

WALTER
Thass me all over. I don't want no partnership when it comes to my
women. Its whole hawg uh none. Lawd, what wimmen makes us do!

LINDSAY
What is it dey don't make us do. Now take for instant Jim Weston. He
know he can't hunt wid Dave--Dave is uh sworn marksman, but jes' so as
not to be outdone here he go trying to shoot turkeys--wild turkeys
mind you, 'ginst Dave.

JOE CLARKE
I God, I hope he finds 'em too. If he get to killin turkeys maybe
he'll stay way from my hen house. I God, I done lost nine uh my best
layin' hens in three weeks.

(General Laughter)

WALTER
Did Jim git em?

CLARKE
I ain't personatin' nobody but I been told dat Jim's got uh powerful
lot uh chicken feathers buried in his back yard. I know one thing if
I ever ketch his toe-nails in my chicken yard, I God, he's gointer
follow his pappy and his four brothers. He's got to git from dis town
of mine.

(Enter a little girl right, very neat and starchy. She runs up to Rev.
Sims.)

GIRL
Papa, mama say send her dat witch hazely oil she sent you after right
quick.

LINDSAY
Whuss matter wid Sister Sims--poly today?

SIMS
She don't keep so well since we been here, but I reckon she's on
de mend.

HAMBO
Don't look like she never would be sick. She look so big and portly.

CLARKE
Size don't mean nothin'. My wife is portly and she be's on de sick
list all de time. It's "Jody, pain in de belly all day. Jody, pain in
de back all night.

LIGE
Besides, Mrs. Simms ain't very large. She wouldn't weigh more'n two
hundred. You ain't seen no big woman. I seen one so big she went to
whip her lil boy an' he run up under her belly and stayed up under
dere for six months.

(General laughter)

WALTER
You seen de biggest ones. But I seen uh woman so little till she could
go out in uh shower uh rain and run between de drops. She had tuh git
up on uh box tuh look over uh grain uh sand.

SIMMS
Y'all boys better read yo' Bibles 'stead of studyin foolishness. (He
gets up and starts into the store. Clarke and the little girl follow
him.) Reckon Ah better git dat medicine. (The three exit into store)

HAMBO
Well, y'all done seen so much--be y'all ain't never seen uh snake big
as de one Ah seen down round Kissimnee. He was so big he couldn't
hardly move his self. He laid in one spot so long he growed moss on
him and everybody thought he was uh log layin' there; till one day Ah
set down on him and went to sleep. When Ah woke up ah wuz in Middle
Georgy.

(General laughter. Two women enter left and go in store after
everybody has spoken to them)

LINDSAY
Layin' all sides to jokes now, y'all remember dat rattlesnake Ah kilt
on Lake Hope was 'most big as dat one.

WALTER
(Nudgin' Lige and winking at the crowd) How big did you say it was, Joe?

LINDSAY
He mought not uh been quite as big as dat one--but jes' bout fourteen
feet.

HAMBO
Gimme dat lyin' snake! He wasn't but fo' foot long when you kilt him
and here you done growed him ten feet after he's dead.

(Enter Simms followed by the girl with an all day sucker. Simms has a
small package in his hand.

SIMMS

(Gives the package to the child and resumes his seat.)

Run 'long home now. Tell yo' ma to put on uh pot uh peas.

(Child exits right trotting and sucking her candy.)

WALTER
They's some powerful big snakes round here. We was choppin' down de
weeds in front of our parsonage yistiddy and kilt uh great big ol'
cotton mouf moccasin.

SIMMS
Yeah, look like me or some of my fambly 'bout to git snake-bit right
at our own front do'.

LIGE
An' bit by uh Baptist snake at dat.

LINDSAY
How you make him out uh Baptist snake?

LIGE
Nobody don't love water lak uh Baptist an' uh Moccasin.

(General laughter)

HAMBO
An' nobody don't hate it lak de devil, uh rattlesnake an uh Meth'dis.

(General laughter. Enter Joe Clark from store. Stands in door)

SIMMS
Dis town needs uh cleanin' in more ways than one. Now if this town was
run right, when folks misbehaves, they oughter be locked up in jail
and if they can't pay no fine, they oughter be made to work it out on
de streets--chopping weeds.

LINDSAY
How we gointer do all dat when we ain't got no jail?

SIMMS
Well, you orta _have_ uh jail. Y'all needs uh whole heap of
improvements in dis town. Ah ain't never pastored no town so way back
as this one here.

CLARKE
(Stepping out before Simms) What improvements you figgers we needs?

SIMMS
A whole heap. Now for one thing, we really does need uh jail, Brother
Mayor. Taint no sense in runnin' people out of town that cuts up. We
oughter have jails like other towns. Every town I ever pastored had
uh jail.

CLARKE
(Angrily) Now hold on uh minute, Simms! Don't you reckon uh man dat
knows how to start uh town knows how to run it? You ain't been here
long enough to find out who started dis town yet. (Very emphatic,
beating of his palm with other fist) Do you know who started dis town?
(Does not pause for an answer) Me! I started _dis_ town. I went to de
white folks and wid _dis_ right hand I laid down two hundred dollars
for de land and walked out and started dis town. I ain't like some
folks--come here when grapes was ripe. I was here to cut new ground.

SIMMS
Well, tain't no sense in one man stayin' Mayor all de time, nohow.

CLARKE
(Triumphantly) So dat de tree you barkin' up? Why, you ain't nothin'
but uh trunk man. You can't be no mayor. I got roots here.

SIMMS
You ain't all de voters, tho, Brother Mayor.

CLARKE
(Arrogantly) I don't hafta be. I God, it's my town and I kin be Mayor
jes' as long as I want to. (Slaps his chest) I God, it was _me_ dat
put dis town on de map.

SIMMS
What map you put it on, Brother Clarke? You musta misplaced it. I
ain't seen it on no map.

CLARKE
Tain't on no map, hunh? I God, everytime I go to Maitland de white
folks calls me Mayor. Otherwise, Simms, I God, if you so dissatisfied
wid de way I run dis town, just take yo' Bible and flat foots and git
younder cross de woods.

SIMMS
(Aggressively) Naw, Ah don't like it. You ack lack tain't nobody in de
corporation but you? Now look. (Points at the street lamp) Tain't but
one street light in town an' you got it in front of yo' place. We pays
de taxes an' you got de lamp.

CLARKE
I God, nobody can't tell me how to run dis town. I 'lected myself and
I'm gonna run it to suit myself. (Looks all about) Where is dat
Marshall? He ain't lit de lamp?

WALTER
Scorched Daisy Blunt home and ain' got back.

CLARKE
I God, call him there, some of you boys.

(Lige steps to edge of porch left and calls "Lum! Lum!" Lum's voice at
a distance: "What!" Lige: "Come on and light de lamp it gittin dark.")

SIMMS
Now, when I pastored in Ocala you oughter seen de lovely jail dey had.

HAMBO
Thass all right for white folks. We colored folks don't need no jail.

WALTER
Aw, yes we do too. Elder Simms is right. We ain't a bit bottern white

MRS. LULU
We been makin' our market.

HAMBO
Looks mighty bad for some man's pocket. But y'all ain't had no treat
on me. Go back and tell Mrs. Clark tuh give you some candy.

LINDSAY
Have somethin' on me too. Money ain't no good lessen de women kin help

MRS. JENNY
Ain't y'all comin' in tuh help us eat de treat. Come on, Elder Simms!

HAMBO
(Getting up quickly. Lindsay and Joe Clarke also get up. They go
inside laughing.) Here, lemme git hold of somebody. (Grabs one of the
women by the arm as they exit into the store.)

LIGE
(Pointing his thumb after the women) Ah wouldn't way lay nothin' lak
dat. Too old even tuh chew peanuts if Ah was tuh buy it.

WALTER
Preach it, Brother. But they's all right for mullet heads like Lindsay
and Hambo. (Sings)

  When they git old, when they [Note: corrected missing space.] git old
  Old folks turns tuh monkeys
      When they git old.

(Looks off right) Lawd! They must be havin' recess in heben! Look at
dese lil ground angels! (Yells off right) Hello Big 'Oman, an' Teets
and Bootsie! Hurry up! My money jumpin' up and down in my pocket lak

cotton dresses. They are all locked armed and giggling)

LIGE
Hello, folkses.

BOOTSIE
(Coquettishly) Hello yo'self--Want uh piece uh corn bread look on de
shelf. (Great burst of laughter from inside the store)

LIGE
(Catching Bootsie's arm) Lemme scorch y'all inside en' treat yuh.

BOOTSIE
(Looks at the other girls for confirmation) Not yet, after while.

WALTER
Well, come set on de piazza an' les' have some chat.

TEETS
We ain't got time. We come tuh git our mail out de postoffice.

LIGE
Youse uh Got-dat-wrong! You come after Dave an' Jim an' Lum. But Daisy
done treed de las' one of 'em. She got Jim and Dave out in de swamp
where de mule was drugged out huntin' her uh turkey. An' she got Lum
at her house. Thass how come de light ain't lit.

BIG 'OMAN
Oh, Ah ain't worried 'bout Lum. Ah b'lieve Ah kin straighten him out.

WALTER
Some wimmen kin git yo' man so he won't stand uh straightenin'.

LIGE
Don't come rollin' yo' eyes at me an' gittin' all mad cause y'all
stuck on de boys and de boys is stuck on Daisy. (makes a sly face
at Walter)

TEETS
Who? Me? Nobody ain't studyin' 'bout ole Daisy. She come before me
like a gnat in a whirlwind.

WALTER
(in mock seriousness) Better stop dat talkin' 'bout Daisy, do I'll
tell her whut you say. I think I better call her anyhow and see
whether you gointer talk dat big talk to her face. (Makes a move as if
to call Daisy)

LIGE
(keeping up the raillery, grabs Walter) Don't do dat, Walter. We don't
want no trouble round here. But sho nuff, [Note: corrected missing
space.] girls, y'all ain't got no time wid Daisy. Know what Lum say?
Says Daisy is a bucket flower--jes' _made_ him to set up on de
porch an' look pritty. I ast him how 'bout de rest an' he says "Oh de
rest is yard flowers jes' plant them any which a way.

BOOTSIE
I don't b'lieve Lum said no sich uh thing.

LIGE
You tellin' dat flat--Ah knows. (Looks off left) Here come Lum, now,
in uh big hurry jus' lak he ain't been gone two hours.

BIG 'OMAN
Less we all go git our treat! (They start up on the porch. At that
moment Hambo, Lindsay, Clarke, Simms, and the two women enter from
the store.)

CLARKE
(to Lige) Looks here, I God! Ain't Lum lit dat lamp yet? (Enter Lum
left hurriedly. Clarke stands akimbo glaring at him. Lum fumbles for a
match, strikes it and drops it. Gets another from his pocket and goes
to the lamp and strikes it.) Somebody reach de numbskull uh box.
(Walter hands Lum a box of the porch and he gets up on it and opens
the lamp to light it.)

LUM
(to Clarke) Reckon Ah better put some oil in de lamp. Tain't much in
it.

CLARKE
(Impatiently) Oh, that'll do! That'll do. It'll be time tuh put it out
befo' you git it lit, I God.

(Lum lights the lamp. The men have resumed their seats and the women
are on the ground and near right exit. Walter and Lige and the three
girls are at the door about to enter the store. Lum has the box in his
hand and is still under the lamp. He walks slowly towards the step,
box in hand. At the step he looks off left.)

LUM
Here come Dave. (All look left. Walter and Lige and the girls abandon
the idea of the treat and wait for Dave)

HAMBO
But ah ain't seen no turkey yet. Dat ole gobbler's too smart for Dave.

(Enter Dave with gun over his shoulder and holding his head. A little
blood is on his shoulder. He pauses under the lamp a moment then comes
to the step)

HAMBO
Whuss de matter, Dave? Dat ole turkey gobbler done pecked you in de
head? Whut kind of a huntsman is you?

(General laughter)

DAVE
Naw, ain't no turkey pecked me. It's Jim. Ah wuz out in de woods and
hand don squatted down before he got dere. Ah know jus' where dat ole
gobbler roost at. Soon's he hit de limb an' squatted hisself, Ah let
'im have it. He flopped his wings an' tried to fly off but here he
come tumblin' down right by dem ole mule bones. Jim, he was jus'
comin' up when Ah fired. So when he seen dat turkey fallin', whut do
he do? He fires off his gun an' make out he kilt dat turkey. Ah beat
him tuh de bird and we got tuh tusslin'. He tries tuh make _me_ give
him _mah_ turkey so's he kin run tuh Daisy an' make out he done kilt
it. So we got tuh fightin' an' Ah wuz beatin' him too till he retched
down an' got de hock bone uh dat mule an' lammed me over de head an'
fore Ah could git up, he done took mah turkey an' went wid it. (to
Clarke) Mist Clarke Ah wants tuh swear out uh warrant ginst Jim
Weston. Ahm gointer law him outa dis town, too.

SIMMS
Dat wuz uh low-down caper, Jim, cut sho nuff.

CLARKE
Sho its uh ugly caper tuh cut. Come on inside, Dave, an Ah'll make out
de papers. He ain't goin' to carry on lak dat in _my_ town.

(Exit Dave and Clarke into de store)

LINDSAY
(Jokingly to Sims) See whut capers you Meth'dis niggers'll
cut--lammin' folks over de head wid mule bones an' stealin' they
turkeys.

SIMMS
Oh you Baptist ain't uh lot better'n nobody else. You steals an'
fights too.

LINDSAY
(still bantering) Yeah, but we done kotched dis Meth'dis nigger an' we
gointer run him right on outa town too. Jus' wait an' see. Yeah, boy.
Dat Jim'll be uh gone gator 'fore tomorrow night.

WALTER
Oh, I don't know whether he's gointer be gone or not. We Meth'dis got
jus' as much say-so in dis town as anybody else.

LIGE
Yeah. You Baptis run yo' mouf but you don't run de town. Furthermo' we
ain't heard nothin' but Dave's lie. Better wait till we see Jim an'
git de straight of dis thing.

HAMBO
Will you lissen at dat? Dese half-washed Christians hates de truth lak
uh bed-bug hates de light. God a' mighty! (rising) Ahm goin' in an'
see to it dat de Mayor makes dem papers out right. (He exits angrily
into the store. Simms and all the men rise too)

SIMMS
Come on Walter, you an Lige. Less we go inside too. Dat po' boy got
tuh git jestice. An' 'tween de Mayor an' dese Baptists he ain't got
much chance. (They exit into the store)

1st WOMAN
Come on you young gals, whut y'all wanta be hangin' round de store an'
its way after black dark. Yo' mammies oughter take an frail de las'
one of yuh! Come along! (The girls come downoff the porch and join the
women. Loud angry voices inside the store)

2nd WOMAN
Lawd, lemme git home an' tell my husban' bout all dis. Umph! Umph!
(The women and girls exit as the men all emerge from the store. Lum
comes first with the warrant in his hand. Clarke emerges last.)

CLARKE
Can't have all dat fuss an' racket in my store. All of you git outside
dat wants tuh fight? (He begins to close up)

SIMMS
But Brother Mayor, I said it, an' I'll say it agin, tain't right--

CLARKE
(turns angrily) I God, Clarke [Hand written correction: Simms], Ah
don't keer whut you say. 'Taint worth uh hill uh beans nohow. Jim is
gointer be 'rested for hittin' Dave an' takin' his turkey, an' if he's
found guilty he's goin' way from here. Tain't no use uh you swellin'
up neither. (to Lum) Go get him, Lum, an' lock 'im in my barn an' put
dat turkey under arrest too. I God, de law is gointer be law in my
town. (Exit Lum with an important air.)

WALTER
Where de trial gointer be, Brother Clarke, in de hall?

CLARKE
Nope, it's too little. It'll hafta be in de Baptist Church. Ah reckon
dat's de bigges' place in town. Three o'clock Monday evening. Now,
y'all git on off my porch tuh fuss. Lige, outen dat lamp for Lum.

(The stage goes black. The crowd is dispersing slowly. Angry voices
are heard. The curtain is descending slowly. Off-stage right the voice
of Lum is heard calling Daisy.)

LUM
Oh Daisy! Daisy!

DAISY
(at a distance) What you want, Lum?

LUM
Tell yo' mama to put on de hot water kittle. I'll be round there
before long.


_CURTAIN_




ACT II


Scene I

SETTING: Village street scene. Huge oak tree upstage center. A house
or two on backdrop. When curtain goes up Sister Lucy Taylor is seen
standing under the tree trying to read a notice posted on the tree.
She is painfully spelling it out. Enter Sister Thomas--a younger woman
(in her thirties) at left.

SISTER THOMAS
Evenin', Sis Taylor.

SISTER TAYLOR
Evenin'. (returns to the notice)

SISTER THOMAS
Whut you doin'? Readin' dat notice Joe Clarke put up 'bout de meetin'?
(approaches tree)

SISTER TAYLOR
Is dat whut it says? I ain't much on readin' since I had my teeth
pulled out. You know if you pull out dem eye teeth you ruins yo' eye
sight. (turns back to notice) Whut it say?

SISTER THOMAS
(Reading notice) The trial of Jim Weston for assault and battery on
Dave Carter wid a dangerous weapon will be held at Macedonia Baptist
Church on Monday November 10, at three o'clock. All are welcome--by
order of J. Clarke, Mayor of Eatonville, Fla. (turning to Sister
Taylor) Hit's makin' on to three now.

SISTER TAYLOR
You mean its right _now_. (looks up at sun to tell time) Lemme go git
ready to be at de trial--cause I'm sho going to be there and I ain't
goin' to bite my tongue neither.

SISTER THOMAS
I done went and crapped a mess of collard greens for supper--I better
go put em on--cause Lawd knows when we goin' to git outa there--and my
husband is one of them dats gointer eat don't keer whut happen. I bet
if Judgment day was to happen tomorrow, he'd speck I orter fix him a
bucket to carry long.

(She moves to exit right)

SISTER TAYLOR
All men favors they guts, chile. But whut you think of all dis mess
they got going on round here?

SISTER THOMAS
I just think its a sin and a shame before de livin justice de way dese
Baptis' niggers is runnin' round here carryin' on.

SISTER TAYLOR
Oh they been puttin out they brags ever since Sat'day night bout whut
they gointer do to Jim. They thinks they runs this town. They tell me
Rev. Singleton preached a sermon on it yesterday.

SISTER THOMAS
Lawd help us! He can't preach and he look like 10¢ worth of have-mercy,
let lone gittin' up dare tryin' to throw slams at us. Now all Elder
Sims done was to explain to us our rights--Whut you think bout Joe
Clarke running round here takin' up for those ole Baptist niggers?

SISTER TAYLOR
De puzzle-gut rascal--we oughter have him up in conference and put him
out de Meth'dis' faith. He don't blong in there--Wanta run dat boy
outa town for nothin'.

SISTER THOMAS
But we all know how come he so hot to law Jim outa town--hits to dig
de foundation out from under Elder Sims--

SISTER TAYLOR
What he wanta do dat for?

SISTER THOMAS
Cause he wants to be a God-knows-it-all an' a God-do-it-all and Simms
is de onliest one in this town whut will buck up to him.

(Enter Sister Jones, walking leisurely)

SISTER JONES
Hello Hoyt, Hello Lucy.

SISTER TAYLOR
Goin' to de meetin'?

SISTER JONES
Done got my clothes on de line and I'm bound to be dere--

SISTER THOMAS
Gointer testify for Jim?

SISTER JONES
Naw. I reckon--Don't make much difference to me which way de drop
fall--Taint neither one of 'em much good.

SISTER TAYLOR
I know it. I know it, Ida. But dat ain't de point. De crow we wants to
pick is, is we gointer set still and let dese Baptist tell us when to
plant and when to pluck up?

SISTER JONES
Dat _is_ something to think about when you come to think about it.
(starts to move on) Guess I better go ahead--See y'all later and tell
you straighter. (Enter Elder Simms right, walking fast, Bible under
his arm, almost collides with Mrs. Jones. She nods and smiles and
exits.)

ELDER SIMMS
How you do, Sister Taylor, Sister Thomas.

BOTH
Good evenin', Elder

SIMMS
Sho is a hot day

SISTER TAYLOR
Yeah, de bear is walkin' de earth lak a natural man.

SISTER THOMAS
Reverend, look like you headed de wrong way. It's almost time for de
trial and youse all de dependence we got.

ELDER SIMMS
I know it. I'm trying to find de Marshall so we kin go after Jim. I
wants a chance to talk wid him a minute before court sits.

SISTER TAYLOR
Y'think he'll come clear?

ELDER SIMMS
(proudly) I _know_ it! (shakes the Bible) I'm going to law 'em from
Genesis to Revelation.

SISTER THOMAS
Give it to 'em, Elder. Wear 'em out!

ELDER SIMMS
We'se liable to have a new Mayor when all dis dust settle. Well, I
better scuffle on down de road.

(Exit Sims left)

SISTER THOMAS
Lord, lemme gwan home and put dese greens on. (looks off stage left)
Here come Mayor Clark now, wid his belly settin' out in front of him
like a cow-catcher. His name oughter be Mayor Belly.

SISTER TAYLOR
(akimbo) Jus' look at him! Trying to look like a jigadier Breneral.

(Enter Clarke hot and perspiring. They look at him coldly.)

CLARKE
I God, de bear got me! (silence for a moment) How y'all feelin'
ladies?

SISTER TAYLOR
Brother Mayor, I ain't one of these folks dat bite my tongue and bust
my gall--Whuts inside got to come out! I can't see to my rest why you
cloakin' in wid dese Baptist buzzards ginst yo' own Church.

MAYOR CLARKE
I ain't cloakin' in wid _none_. I'm de Mayor of dis whole town.
I stands for de right and against de wrong. I don't keer who it kill
or cure.

SISTER THOMAS
You think it's right to be runnin' dat boy off for nothin?

MAYOR CLARKE
I God! You call knockin' a man in de head wid a mule bone nothin'?
'Nother thing--I done missed nine of my best-layin' hens. I ain't
sayin' Jim got 'em--but different people has told me he buries a
powerful lot of feathers in his back yard. I God, I'm a ruint man! (He
starts towards the right exit, but Lum Rogers enters right.) I God,
Lum, I been lookin' for you all day. It's almost three o'clock. (hands
him a key from his ring) Take dis key and go fetch Jim Weston on to de
church.

LUM
Have you got yo' gavel from de lodge-room?

CLARKE
I God, that's right, Lum. I'll go get it from de lodge room whilst you
go git de bone an' de prisoner. Hurry up! You walk like dead lice
droppin' off you! (He exits right while Lum crosses stage towards
left)

SISTER TAYLOR
Lum, Elder Simms been huntin' you--he's gone on down bout de barn.
(She gestures.)

LUM
I reckon I'll overtake him. (Exit left)

SISTER THOMAS
I better go put dese greens on--my husband will kill me if he don't
find no supper ready. Here come Mrs. Blunt. She oughter feel like a
penny's worth of have-mercy wid all dis stink behind her daughter.

SISTER TAYLOR
Chile, some folks don't keer. They don't raise they chillen, they
drags 'em up. God knows if dat Daisy was mine, I'd throw her down and
put a hundred lashes on her back wid a plow-line. Here she come in de
store Sat'day night (acts coy and coquettish, burlesques Daisy's walk)
a wringing and a twisting!

(Enter Mrs. Blunt left.)

MRS. BLUNT
How y'all sisters?

SISTER THOMAS
Very well, Miz Blunt, how you?

MRS. BLUNT
Oh so-so.

SISTER TAYLOR
I'm kickin' but not high.

MRS. BLUNT
Well, thank God you still on prayin' ground and in a Bible
Country--Me, I ain't many today. De niggers got my Daisy's name all
mixed up in diss mess.

SISTER TAYLOR
You musn't mind dat, Sister Blunt. People just _will_ talk. They's
talkin' in New York and they's talkin' in Georgy and they's talkin' in
Italy.

SISTER THOMAS
Chile, if you talk after niggers they'll have you in de graveyard or
in Chattahoochee one. You can't pay no tention to talk.

MRS. BLUNT
Well, I know one thing--de man or woman, chick or child, grizzly or
gray that tells me to my face anything wrong bout _my_ chile--I'm
going to take _my_ fist (rolls up right sleeve and gestures with right
fist) and knock they teeth down they throat. (She looks ferocious.)
Cause y'll know I raised my Daisy right round my feet till I let her
go up north last year wid them white folks. I'd ruther her to be in de
white folks kitchen than walkin' de streets like some of dese girls
round here. If I do say so, I done raised a lady. She can't help it if
all dese men get stuck on her.

SISTER TAYLOR
You'se telling de truth, Sister Blunt--that's what I always say--Don't
confidence dese niggers, do they'll sho put you in de street.

SISTER THOMAS
Naw indeed. Never syndicate wid niggers--do--they will distriminate
you. They'll be an _anybody_. You goin to de trial, ain't you?

MRS. BLUNT
Just as sho as you snore, and they better leave Daisy's name outer dis
too. I done told her and told her to come straight home from her work.
Naw, she had to stop by dat store and skin her gums back wid dem
trashy niggers. She better not leave them white [Corrected missing
space.] folks today to come praipsin over here scornin her name all up
wid dis nigger mess--do, I'll kill her. No daughter of mine ain't
going to do as she please long as she live under de sound of my voice.
(She crosses to right.)

SISTER THOMAS
That's right, Sister Blunt--I glory in yo' spunk. Lord, I better go
put on my supper. (As Mrs. Blunt exits right, Rev. Singletary enters
left with Dave and Deacon Lindsay and Sister Lewis. Very hostile
glances from Sisters Thomas and Taylor towards the others.

ELDER SINGLETARY
Good evening, folks.

(Sister Thomas and Sister Taylor just grunt. Sister Thomas moves a
step or two towards exit. Flirts her skirts and exits.)

LINDSAY
(Angrily) Whuts de matter, y'all? Cat got yo' tongue?

SISTER TAYLOR
More matter than you kin scatter all over Cincinnatti.

LINDSAY
Go head on, Lucy Taylor, go head on. You know a very little of yo'
sugar sweetens my coffee. Go head on. Everytime you lift yo' arm you
smell like a nest of yellow hammers.

SISTER TAYLOR
Go head on yo'self. Yo' head look like it done wore out three
bodies--talking bout _me_ smelling--you smell lak a nest of grand
daddies yo'self.

LINDSAY
Aw, rack on down de road, 'oman. Ah don't wantuh change words wid yuh.
You'se too ugly.

MRS. TAYLOR
You ain't nobody's pretty baby yo'self. You so ugly I betcha yo' wife
have to spread uh sheet over yo' head tuh let sleep slip up on yuh.

LINDSAY
(Threatening) You better git 'way from me while you able. I done tole
you I don't wants break a mouth wid you. It's a whole heap better tuh
walk off on yo own legs than it is to be toted off. I'm tired of yo'
achin round here. You fool wid me now an' I'll knock you into doll
rags, Tony or no Tony.

SISTER TAYLOR
(jumping up in his face) Hit me! Hit me! I dare you tuh hit me. If you
take dat dare you'll steal a hawg an' eat his hair.

LINDSAY
Lemme gwan down to dat church befo' you make me stomp you.
(He exits right.)

SISTER TAYLOR
You mean you'll _git_ stomped. Ahm going to de trial too. De nex trial
gointer be _me_ for kickin some uh you Baptis niggers around.

(A great noise is heard off stage left. The angry and jeering voices
of children. Mrs. Taylor looks off left and takes a step or two
towards left exit as the noise comes nearer.)

VOICE OF ONE CHILD
Tell her! Tell her! Turn her up and smell her. Yo' mama ain't got
nothin to do wid me.

SISTER TAYLOR
(Hollering off left) You lil Baptis haitians, leave them chillun
alone. If you don't, you better!

(Enter about 10 chidren struggling and wrestling in a bunch. Mrs.
Taylor looks about on the ground for a stick to strike the children
with.)

VOICE OF CHILD IN CROWD
Hey! Hey! He's skeered tuh knock it off. Coward!

SISTER TAYLOR
If y'all don't git on home!

SASSY LITTLE GIRL
(Standing akimbo) I know you better not touch me, do my mama will tend
to you.

SISTER TAYLOR
(Making as if to strike her) Shet up, you nasty lil heifer, sassing
me! You ain't half raised.

(The little girl shakes herself at Mrs. Taylor and is joined by two or
three others.)

SISTER TAYLOR
(Walking towards right exit) I'm going on down to de church an' tell
yo' mammy. But she ain't been half raised herself. (She exits right
with several children making faces behind her.)

A BOY
(to sassy girl) Aw haw! Y'all ol' Baptis ain't got no book case in yo'
church. We went there one day an' I saw uh soda cracker box settin' up
in de corner so I set down on it. (pointing at sassy girl) Know whut
ole Mary Ella say? (jeering laughter) Willie, you git up off our
library! Haw! Haw!

MARY ELLA
Y'all ole Meth'dis' ain't got no window panes in yo' ole church.

A GIRL
(Takes center of stage and hands akimbo shakes her hips.) I don't keer
whut y'allsay. I'm a Methdis' bred an' uh Methdis' born an' when I'm
dead there'll be uh Methdis' gone.

MARY ELLA
(snaps fingers under other girl's nose and starts singing. Several
join her.)

  Oh Baptis, Baptis is my name
  My name's written on high
  I got my lick in de Baptis church
  Gointer eat up de Methdis pie

(the Methodist children jeer and make faces. The Baptist camp make
faces back for a full minute there is silence while each camp tries to
outdo the other in face making. The Baptist makes the last face.

METHODIST BOY
Come on, less us don't notice em. Less gwan down to de church an' hear
de trial.

MARY ELLA
Y'all ain't the onliest ones kin go. We goin' too.

WILLIE
Aw Haw! Copy cats! (Makes face) Dat's right, follow on behind us lak
uh puppy dog tail. (They start walking toward right exit switching
their clothes behind.)

(Baptist children stage a rush and struggle to get in front of the
methodists. They finally succeed in flinging some of the Methodist
children to the ground and some behind them and walk towards right
exit haughtily switching their clothes.)

WILLIE
(whispers to his crowd) Less go round by Mosely's lot and beat 'em
there!

OTHERS
All right!

WILLIE
(Yelling to Baptists) We wouldn't walk behind no ole Baptists! (The
Methodists turn and walk off towards left exit switching their clothes
as the Baptists are doing.)


_SLOW CURTAIN_




ACT II


SCENE II

SETTING: Interior of Macedonia Baptist Church, a rectangular room,
windows on each side, two "Amen Corners", pulpit with a plush cover
with heavy fringe, practical door in pulpit, practical door in front
of church, two oil brackets with reflectors on each side wall with
lamps missing all but one, one big oil lamp in center.

ACTION: At the rise, church is about full. A buzz and hum fills the
church. Voices of children angry and jeering heard from the street.
The church bell begins to toll for death. Everybody looks shocked.

SISTER LEWIS
Lawd! Is Dave done died from dat lick?

SISTER THOMAS
(to her husband) Walter, go see. (He gets up and starts down the aisle
to front door. Enter Deacon Hambo by front door.)

WALTER
Who dead?[Note: correction to e]

HAMBO
(laughing) Nobody--jus' tollin' de bell for dat Meth'dis gopher dat's
gointer be long long gone after dis trial. (laughter from the Baptist
side)

WALTER
Y'all sho thinks you runs dis town, dontcher? But Elder Simms'll show
you somethin' t'day. If he don't, God's uh gopher.

HAMBO
He can't show us nothin' cause he don't know nothin' hisself.

WALTER
He got mo' book-learnin' than Rev. Singletary got.

HAMBO
He mought be unletter-learnt, but he kin drive over Sims like a
road plow.

METHODIST CHORUS
Aw, naw! Dat's a lie!

(Enter Rev. Simms by front door with open Bible in hand. A murmur of
applause arises on the Methodist side, grunts on the Baptist side.
Immediately behind him comes Lum Boger leading Jim Weston. They parade
up to the right Amen Corner and seat themselves on the same bench, Jim
between the Marshall and the preacher. A great rooster crowing and hen
cackling arises on the Baptist side. Jim Weston jumps angrily to his
feet.)

(Enter by front door Rev. Singletary and Dave. Dave's head is
bandaged, but he walks firmly and seems not ill at all. They sit in
the left Amen Corner. Jeering grunts from the Methodist side.)

SISTER THOMAS
Look at ol' Dave trying to make out he's hurt.

LIGE
Everybody know uh Baptis' head is hardern uh rock. Look like they'd be
skeered tuh go in swimmin', do they heads would drown 'em. (general
laughter on Methodist side)

(Enter Bro. Nixon with his jumper jacket on his arm and climbs over
the knees of a bench full of people and finds seat against the wall
directly beneath empty lamp bracket. He looks around for some place to
dispose of his coat. Sees the lamp-bracket and hangs up the coat,
hitches up his pants and sits down.)

SISTER LEWIS
(rising and glaring at Nixon) Shank Nixon, you take yo' lousy coat
down off these sacred walls. Ain't you Methdis' niggers got no
gumption in de house of Wash-up!

(Nixon mocks her by standing akimbo and shaking himself like a woman.
General laughter. He prepares to resume his seat but looks over and
sees Deacon Hambo on his feet, and glaring angrily at him. He quickly
reaches up and takes the coat down and folds it across his knees.)

(Sister Taylor looks very pointedly at Sister Lewis then takes a dip
of snuff and looks sneering at Lewis again.)

SISTER TAYLOR
Some folks is a whole lot more keerful bout a louse in de church than
[Note: corrected missing space] they is in they house. (Looks
pointedly at Sister Lewis.)

SISTER LEWIS
(bustling) Whut you gazin' at me for? Wid your pop-eyes looking like
skirt ginny-nuts.

SISTER TAYLOR
I hate to tell you whut yo' mouf looks like. I sho do you and soap and
soap and water musta had some words.

SISTER LEWIS
Talkin' bout other folks being dirty--yo' young 'uns must be sleep in
they draws cause you kin smell 'em a mile down de road.

SISTER TAYLOR
Taint no lice on 'em though.

SISTER LEWIS
You got just as many bed-bugs and chinches as anybody else, don't come
trying to hand me dat rough package bout yo' house so clean.

SISTER TAYLOR
Yeah, but I done seen de bed-bugs munchin' out yo' house in de
mornin', keepin' step just like soldiers drillin'. An' you got so many
lice I seen em on de dish-rag. One day you tried to pick up de
dish-rag and put it in de dish water and them lice pulled back and
tole you "Aw naw, damned if I'm going to let you drown me." (Loud
laughter from the Methodist side)

SISTER LEWIS
(furious--rises akimbo) Well, my house might not be exactly clean, but
there's no fly-specks on my character! They didn't have to sit de
sheriff to make Willie marry _me_ like they did to make Tony marry
_you_.

SISTER TAYLOR
(Jumping up and starts across the aisle. She is pulled back out of the
aisle by friends.) Yeah, they got de sheriff to make Tony marry me,
but he married me and made me a good husband, too. I sits in my
rocking cheer on my porch every Sat'day evening and say "here come
Tony and them--

SISTER LEWIS
Them what?

SISTER TAYLOR
Them dollars. Now you sho orter go git de sheriff and a shot-gun and
make some of dese men marry yo' daughter Ada.

SISTER LEWIS
(Jumping up and starting across the aisle. She is restrained, but
struggles hard.) Lemme go, Jim Merchant! Turn me go! I'm going to
stomp de black heifer till she can't sit down.

SISTER TAYLOR
(Also struggling) Let her come on! If I get my hands on her I'll turn
her every way but loose.

SISTER LEWIS
Just come on out dis church, Lucy Taylor. I'll beat you on everything
you got but yo' tongue and I'll bit dat a lick if you stick it out.
(to the men holding her) Turn me go! I'm going to fix her so her own
mammy won't know her. She ain't going to slip _me_ into de dozens and
laugh about it.

SISTER TAYLOR
(Trying to free herself) Why don't y'all turn dat ole twist mouth
'oman loose. All I wants to do is hit her one lick. I betcha I'll take
her 'way from here faster than de word of God.

SISTER LEWIS
(to men holding Mrs. Taylor) I don't see how come y'all want let ole
flat-behind Lucy Taylor aloose--make out she so bad, now. She may be
red hot but I kin cool her. I'll ride her just like Jesus rode a
jackass.

(They have subsided into their seats again, but are glaring at each
other. Enter Mayor Clarke thru the pulpit door and is annoyed at the
clamor going on. He tries to quell the noise with a frown.)

SISTER TAYLOR
Dat ain't nothin' but talk--You looks lak de Devil before day, but you
ain't so bad--not half as bad as you smell.

CLARKE
Order, please. Court is set.

SISTER LEWIS
You looks like all hell and de devil's doll baby, but all I want _you_
to do is to hit de ground and I'll crawl you. Put it where I kin git
it and I'll sho use it.

MAYOR CLARKE
(feeling everywhere for the gavel) Lum Boger! Where's dat gavel I told
you to put here?

LUM
(from beside prisoner) You said _you_ were going to git it yo'self.

CLARKE
I God, Lum, you gointer stand there like a bump on a log and see I
ain't got nothin' to open court wid? Go head--fetch me dat gavel. Make
haste quick before dese wimmen folks tote off dis church house. (Lum
exits by front door)

SISTER TAYLOR
(to Lewis) Aw, shut up, you big old he-looking rascal you! Nobody
don't know whether you'se a man or a woman.

CLARKE
You wimmen, shut up!

SISTER LEWIS
(to Taylor) Air Lawd! Dat ain't _yo_ trouble. They all _knows_ whut
_you_ is--eg-zackly!

LINDSAY
Aw, why don't you wimmen cut dat out in de church-house! Jus' jawin'
and chewin' de rag!

SISTER TAYLOR
Joe Lindsay, if you'd go home and feed dat raw-boned horse of yourn
you wouldn't have so much time to stick yo' bill in business that
ain't yourn.

LINDSAY
You ain't got nairn to feed--You better go hunt another dead dog and
git some mo' teeth. Great big ole empty mouf, and no cheers in de
parlar.

SISTER TAYLOR
I kin git all de teeth I wants--I'd ruther not have no cheers in my
parlor than to have them ole snags you got in yo' mouf. I'd ruther gum
it out.

LINDSAY
You don't _ruther_ gum it out, you _hafta_ gum it out. You ain't got
no teeth. Dey better send out to dat ole mule and git you some
teethes.

SISTER LEWIS
Joe Lindsay, don't you know no better than to strain wid folks ain't
got sense enough to tote guts to a bean? If they ain't born wid no
sense you cna't learn 'em none.

LINDSAY
You sho done tole whut God love now. (Glaring across the aisle) Ain't
got enough gumption to kill a buzzard.

(Enter Lum by front door with gavel in one hand and mule bone in the
other. He walks importantly up the aisles and hands Clarke the gavel
and lays the bone atop the pulpit.)

CLARKE
(rapping sharply with gavel) Here! You moufy wimmen shut up. (to Lum)
Lum, go on back there and shut dem wimmen up or put 'em outa here.

(Lum starts walking importantly down the aisle towards Sister Taylor.
she almost rises to meet him.)

SISTER TAYLOR
Lum Boger, you fresh little snot you! Don't you dast to come here
trying to put _me_ out--Many diapers as I done pinned on _you_! Git
way from me befo' I knock every nap off of yo' head, one by one.

(Lum hurries away from her apologetically. He turns towards Mrs.
Lewis.)

MRS. LEWIS
Deed Godknows you better not lay de weight of yo' hand on _me_, Lum.
Here you ain't dry behind de ears yert and come telling _me_ what to
do. Gwan way from here before I kick yo' clothes up round you' neck
like a horse collar.

(Lum goes on back and takes his seat beside the prisoner.)

CLARKE
(glaring ferociously) This court is set and I'm bound to have some
order or else. (The talking ceases. Absolute quiet)

CLARKE
Now less git down to business. We got folks in dis town dat's just
like a snake in de grass.

SISTER BOGER
Brother Mayor! We ain't got no business going into no trial nor
northin' else 'thout a word of prayer--to be sure de right spirit is
wid us.

VOICE ON METHODIST SIDE
Thass right,--Elder Simms, give us a word of prayer. (He rises
hurriedly.)

VOICE ON BAPTIST SIDE
This is a Baptist Church and de pastor is settin' right here--how come
he can't pray in his own church?

VOICE ON METHODIST SIDE
Y'all done started all dis mess--how you going to git de right spirit
here? Go head, Rev. Simms.

VOICE ON BAPTIST SIDE
He can't pray over me. Dis Church says one Lord, one faith, one
Baptism--and a man that ain't never been baptised atall ain't got no
business praying over nobody.

CLARKE
(rapping with gavel) Less sing! Somebody raise a tune.

(VOICE ON BAPTIST SIDE begins "Onward Christian Soldiers" and the
others join in.)

(VOICE ON METHODIST SIDE begins "All hail the power of Jesus name" and
the Methodists join in. Both shout as loud as they can to the end of
the verse.)

(Mayor Clarke raps loudly for order at the end of the verse and lifts
his hands as if to bless a table)

CLARKE
(praying) Lord be withus and bless these few remarks we are about to
receive, Amen. Now this court is open for business. All of us know we
came here on serious business. This town is bout to be tore up by
back-biting and malice. Now everybody that's a witness in this case
stand up. I wants the witness to take the front seat.

(Nearly everybody in the room rises. Brother Hambo frowns across the
aisle at Mrs. McDuffy, who is standing.)

BROTHER HAMBO
Whut _you_ doing standin' up for a witness? I know you wasn't there.
You don't know one thing about it.

SISTER McDUFFY
I got just as much right to testify as you is. I don't keer if I
wasn't there. Any man that treat they wife bad as _you_ can't tell
nobody else they eye is black. You clean round yo' _own_ door before
you go sweeping round other folks.

SISTER LINDSAY
(to Nixon) What you doin' up there testifying? When you done let yo'
hawg root up all my p'tater patch.

NIXON
Aw shut up woman--You ain't had no taters for no pit to root up.

SISTER LINDSAY
Who ain't had no taters? (To Lige) Look here, Lige, didn't I git a
whole crokus sack full of tater slips from yo' brother Sam?

LIGE
(reluctantly) Yeah.

SISTER LINDSAY
Course I had sweet p'taters! And if you stand up there and tell _me_ I
ain't had no p'taters I'll be all over you just like gravy over rice.

NIXON
Aw shut up--We ain't come here to talk about yo' tater vines, we come--

SISTER LINDSAY
(to her husband) Joe! What kind of a husband is you? Set here and let
Nixon 'buse me out lak dat!

WALTER
How is he going to give anybody a straightening when he needs
straightening hisself. I bought a load of compost from him and _paid
for it in advance_ and he come there when I wasn't home and dumped a
half-a-load in there and drove on off wid my money.

SISTER HAMBO
Aw, you ain't got no right to talk, Walter, not low down as you is--if
somebody stump their toe in dis town you won't let yo' shirt-tail
touch you till you bolt over to Maitland and puke yo' guts to de white
folks--and God knows I 'bominates a white folks nigger.

WALTER
Aw you just mad cause I wouldn't let your old starved-out cow eat up
my cow-peas.

SISTER HAMBO
(triumphantly) Unhumh! I knowed you was the one knocked my cow's horn
off! And you lied like a doodle-bug going backwards in his hole and
made out you didn't do it.

WALTER
I didn't do no such a thing.

SISTER HAMBO
I say you did and belong to Macedonia Baptist Church and I can't lie.

WALTER
Yo' mouf is cut cross ways, ain't it? Well then, yo' mouf ain't no
prayer-book even if yo' lips do flap like a Bible. You kin lie and
then re-lie.

DEACON HAMBO
Walter Thomas talk dat biggity talk to me, not to my wife. Maybe you
kin whip her, but if you can't whip me too, don't bring de mess up.

CLARKE
(rapping) Y'all men folks shut up before I put you both under arrest.
Come to order everybody.

LINDSAY
I just wants say this before we go any further. Nobody bet not slur my
wife in here--do I'll strow 'em all over de county.

MRS. NIXON
Aw, youse de nastiest threatener in three states but I ain't seen you
do nothin'. De seat of yo' pants is too close to de ground for you to
be crowin' so loud. You so short you smell right earthy.

MRS. LINDSAY
De seat of yo' husband's britches been draggin' de ground ever since I
knowed him. Don't like it dontcher take it, here's my collar come and
shake it. (She puts the palms of her hands together and holding the
heels together, flaps the fore part of her hands like a gator opening
and shutting its mouth. This infuriates Mrs. Nixon.

CLARKE
Shut up! We didn't come here to wash and iron niggers. We come here
for a trial. (raps)

MRS. NIXON
(to Clarke) I ain't going to shut up nothin' of de kind. Think I'm
going to let her low-rate me and I take it all? Naw indeed. I'm going
to sack dis female out before we any further go.

MRS. LINDSAY
Aw, I done dished you out too many times. Go head on and try to keep
yo' lil squatty husband away from down on de lake wid wimmens and
you'll have _all_ you can do. How does old heavy-hipted mama talk?

(snaps her fingers)

MRS. NIXON
Nobody wouldn't have you if he could get anybody else.
(She makes a circle with her thum and first finger and
holds it up for Mrs. Lindsay to see.) Come thru--don't
you feel cheap?

CLARKE
Sister Nixon, shut up!

SISTER NIXON
You can't shut me up, not the way you live. When you quit beatin Mrs.
Mattie and dominizing her all de time then you kin tell other folks
what to do. You ain't none of my boss. Don't let yo' wooden God and
corn-stalk Jesus fool you now. Now de way you sells rancid bacon for
fresh.

NIXON
Aw, honey, hush a while, please and less git started.

(A momentary quiet falls on the place. Mayor glowers all over the
place. Turns to Lum.)

CLARKE
Lum, git a piece of paper and a pencil and take de names of all de
witnesses _who was dere while de fight was going on_.

LUM
(Pulling a small tablet and pencil out of his coat pocket) I brought
it with me.

CLARKE
Now everybody who was at de fight hold up yo' hands so Lum can know
who you are.

(Several hands go up. Sister Anderson puts up her hand.)

CLARKE
You wasn't there, Sister Anderson, not at that time.

SISTER ANDERSON
I hadn't been gone more'n ten minutes 'fore Dave come in from de
woods.

CLARKE
But you didn't see it.

SISTER ANDERSON
It don't make no difference--my husband heered every word was spoke
and told me jes' lak it happen. Don't tell _me_ I can't testify.

DEACON HAMBO
Nobody can't testify but de two boys cause nobody wuz at de fight but
dem.

SISTER ANDERSON
Dat's all right too, Brother, but I know whut they wuz fightin' about
an' it wudn't no turkey neither. It wuz Daisy Blunt.

MRS. BLUNT
Just you take my chile's name right out yo' mouf, Becky Anderson. She
wuznt out in dat cypress swamp. Leave her out dis mess.

REV. SIMMS
You ain't got no call to be so touchous bout yo' girl, but you sho
said a mouthful, Sister Blunt. Dis sho is a mess. Can't help from
being uh mess. (glares at Mayor) Holdin' a trial in de Baptist Church!
Some folks ain't got sense enough todo 'em till four o'clock and its
way after half past tree right now.

MAYOR
Shet up, dere, Simms! Set down! Who ast yo' pot to boil, nohow! Court
is de best church they is, anyhow, cause you come in court. You better
have a good experience and a strong determination. (raps vigorously)
Now lemme tell _y'all_ something. When de Mayor sets Court--don't keer
when I sets it nor where I sets it, you got to git quiet and stay
quiet till I ast you tuh talk. I God, you sound lak a tree full uh
blackbirds! Dis ain't no barbecue, nor neither no camp meetin'. We
'sembled here tuh law uh boy on a serious charge. (A great buzz rises
from the congregation. Mayor raps hard for order and glares all about
him.) Hear! Hear! All of us kin sing at de same time, but can't but
one of us talk at a time. I'm doin' de talkin' now, so de rest of you
dry up till I git through. I God, you sound lak uh passle uh dog
fights! We ain't here for no form and no fashion and no outside show
to de world. Wese here to law. (to Lum) You done got all de witnesses
straight--Got they names down?

LUM
Yessuh, I got it all straightened out.

CLARKE
Well, read de names out and let de witnesses take de front seats.

LUM
Mr. Clarke, I done found out nobody wasn't at dat fight but Jim and
Dave and de mule bones. Dere's de bone Dave got hit wid up on de
rostrum and deres Jim and Dave in de Amen Corners.

DAVE
(rising excitedly) Mist' Clarke! Brother Mayor, I wants to ast uh
question right now to git some information.

MAYOR
All right, Dave, go head and ast it.

DAVE
Brother Mayor, I wanted to know whut become of my turkey gobbler?

MAYOR
I God, Dave, youse in order. Lum! I God, I been layin' off to ast you
whut you dont wid dat turkey. Where is it?

(A burst of knowing laughter from the house)

LUM
(very embarrassed) Well, when you tole me to go 'rrest Jim and de
turkey, I took and went on round to his ma's house and he wudnt dere
so I took and turnt round and made it t'wards Daisy's house an' I
caught up wid him under dat China-berry tree jest befo' you gits tuh
Daisy's house. He was makin' it on t'wards her house wid de turkey in
one hand--his gun crost his shoulder when I hailed 'im. I hollered
"Jim, hold on dere uh minute!" He dropped de turkey and wheeled and
throwed de gun on me.

MAYOR CLARKE
I God, he drawed uh gon on de City Marshall?

LUM
Yessir! He sho did. Thought I was Dave. Tole me: "Don't you come
another step unless you want to see yuh Jesus." I hollered back "It's
me, I ain't no Dave Carter." So he took de gun offa me and I went up
to him and put him under arrest, and locked him up in yo' barn and
brought _you_ de key, didn't I?

CLARKE
You sho did, but I God, I ast you whut become of de turkey?

LUM
De turkey wasn't picked or nothin', so I put him under 'rrest too,
jus' lak you tole me. (general laughter)

CLARKE
I God, Lum, whut did you _do_ wid de turkey after you put him under
'rrest?

LUM
Jim, he didn't want to come wid me till he could make it to Daisy's
house to give her det turkey but, bein so close up on him till he
couldn't draw his rifle, I throwed my 32:20 in his face an' tole him I
said "Don't you move! Don't you move uh pig do I'll burn you down! I
got my burner cocked dead in yo' face and I'll keer you down jus' lak
good gas went up. Come on wid me!" So I took his rifle and picked up
de turkey and marched him off to yo' cow-lot. Ast him didn't I do it.
I tole him, I said "I know you Westons goes for bad but I'm yo' match.
I said you may be slick but you kin stand another greasing. Now sir! I
ain't skeered uh nobody. I'll put de whole town under 'rrest.

MAYOR CLARKE
I God, Lum, if you don't tell me whut you done wid dat turkey, you
better! (draws back the gavel as if to hurl it at Lum) I'll lam you
over de head wid dis mallet! Whut did you do wid dat gobbler turkey?

LUM
Being as he wasn't picked or nothin', I know you didn't want to be
bothered wid it, so I took and carried it over to Mrs. Blunt's house
and she put on some hot water and we set up way Sat'day night pickin
de turkey and fixin him so nex' day she cooked him off--just sorta
baked him wid a lil stuffin an' such, so he'd keep.

MAYOR CLARKE
Didn't you know my wife knowed how to cook? Go fetch dat turkey here,
and don't let no dead lice fall off of you on de way.

LUM
(extremely embarrassed) I don't speck he's dere now, Mist' Clarke.

CLARKE
(ferociously) How come?

LUM
I passed by dere on Sunday and et a lil piece of shoulder offa him,
an' being everybody else was eatin' turkey too, I et some breast meat
an' uh mouf ful or two of stuffin' an' uh drum stick wid de ham part
of de leg hung on to it wid a lil gravy. (general laughter) I thought
I was doin' right cause [Note: corrected missing space] de turkey was
kilt for Daisy anyhow. So I jus' took it on to her. Dave was all hurt
up and Jim was locked up so--

CLARKE
Dat'll do! Dat'll do! Dry up, Suh! (turns to Dave) Stand up, Dave.
Since youse de one got hurted, you be de first witness and tell me
just whut went on out dere.

(Dave rises slowly.)

SISTER TAYLOR
Dat's right, Dave. Git up dere and lie lak de cross ties from New York
to Texas. You greasy rascal you! You better go wash yo'self before you
go testifying on people.

DAVE
I'm just as clean as you.

REV. SINGLETARY
(jumping to his feet) Wait a minute! Taint none of y'all got no call
to be throwin' off on dis boy. He come here to git justice, not to be
slurred and low-rated. He ain't 'ssaulted nobody. He ain't stole no
turkeys _nor_ chickens. He's a clean boy. He set at my feet in Sunday
school since he was so high, (measures knee height) and he come thru
religion under de sound of my voice an' I baptized him and I know he's
clean.

SISTER TAYLOR
It'll take more'n uh baptizin' to clean dat nigger.

DAVE
I goes in swimmin' nearly every day. I'm just as clean as anybody
else.

SISTER TAYLOR
(Mayor begins rapping for order. She shouts out) Swimmin! Dat ain't
gointer clean de crust offa _you_. You ain't had a good bath since de
devil was a hatchet. If you ain't been parboiled in de wash pot and
scoured wid Red Seal lye, don't bring de mess up.

CLARKE
I'm goin' to have order here or else! Gwan, Dave.

DAVE
It's just lak I tole you Sat'day night.

CLARKE
Yeah, but dat wuz at de store. Dis is in [Note: corrected missing
space] court and it's got to be tole agin.

ELDER SIMMS
Just uh minute, Brother Clarke, before we any further go I wants to
ast de witness uh question dat oughter be answered before he open his
mouf.

MAYOR CLARKE
Whut _kind_ of a question is dat?

SIMMS
Dave, tell de truth. Ain't yo' heart full of envy and malce 'gainst
dis chile? (Gestures towards Jim. Dave shakes his head and starts to
deny the charge but Simms hurries on.) Wait a minute now! Wait till I
git thru. Didn't y'all used to run around everywhere playin' and
singing andeverything till you got so full of envy and malce and
devilment till y'al broke up? Now, Brother Mayor, make him tell de
truth.

DAVE
Yeah, I useter be crazy bout Jim, and we was buddies till he tried to
back bite me wie, wid my girl.

JIM
Never _was_ yo girl. Nohow I ain't none of yo' buddy. I ain't got no
buddy. They kilt my buddy tryin' to raise me. But I did useter lak you
till you acted so low down tryin' to undermine me and root me out wid
my girl.

MAYOR
Aw, table dat business an' less open up new business. We ain't here to
find out whose girl it is. We wants to know 'bout dis fight and who
hit de first lick and how come. Go head on Dave and talk.

DAVE
Well, jus lak I tole yuh, Sat'day night, I been watchin' dat flock uh
wild turkeys ever since way last summer roostin' in de edge of dat
cypress swamp out by Howell Creek, where Brazzle's ole mule was
dragged out. It was a great, bit ole gobbler leadin' de flock. So last
time I seen him I said I was gointer git him for my girl if it taken
me uh year. So Sat'day, kinda late, I grabs ole Hannah, my gun, I
calls her Old Hannah, and come to de store to buy some shells. Y'all
know whut went on at de store. Well, it made me feel lak I wuz
gointergit dat ole gobbler if I had to follow him clean to Diddy war
Diddy or slap into Ginny-Gall. But I didn't have to do nothin'. When I
got out by de ole mule bones, I seen 'em flyin' round lak buzzards. So
I loaded both barrels, squatted down on uh log where I had dead aim on
dat big ole cypress pine where they roosts at. Sho nuff, soon's de sun
had done set, here dey come followin' de leader'. He lit way out on de
end of de limb kinda off from de rest and I eased ole Hannah up on
him. Man! I got so skeered I wuz gointer miss him till I got de all
overs. He gobbled two three times to see if all his fambly was safed
den he settled down and bam! I let him have it! He spread his wings
lak he wuz gointer fly on off an' I _cried_ lak a chile! But I got him
alright and down he come floppin, and me grabbin him before he quit
kickin. Gee, I was proud. He felt lak he weighed forty pounds. Whilst
I was kinda heftin him in my hands I heard uh rifle fire and I looked
and dere was Jim firin into de turkey flock dat was flyin round
skeered. He didn't hit a God's thing, but he seen me wid my gobbler
and come runnin up talking bout give him his turkey. I ast him "who
turkey you talkin bout?[Note: missing double quote?] He says dat one
of hisn I hed done grabbed. I tole him he must gone crazy in de head.
He says, I better give him his turkey before he beat my head off. I
tole him I wasn't gointer give nobody but Daisy Blunt dat turkey.
Otherwise, if he wanted to try my head, I wasn't runnin uh damn step.
Come on. So he jumped on me and tried to snatch de turkey. We fit all
over de place. First we was just tusslin for de bird, but when he
found out he couldn't take it he hit me wid his fist. Den I ups wid my
African soup bone and I bet I plowed up uh acre uh bushes wid his
head. He hit ker-bam! right in dat pack uh mule bones and I turnt and
started off, when lo and behold, he gits up wid dat hock bone and lams
me in de head and when I come to, him and my turkey was gone. So I
come swore out uh warrant aginst him cause didn't fight fair. I ain't
mad. I always lakted Jim, but he sho done dirty--lammin me wid uh mule
bone and takin' [Note: corrected missing space] my turkey.

(Dave resumes his seat and Jim drops his head for a moment, then
snatches it up arrogantly and glares at the Baptists. The whole place
is very silent for a moment. Then Mayor Clarke clears his throat, raps
with his gavel and looks sternly at Jim.)

CLARKE
Jim Weston, stand up suh! (Jim rises sullenly.) Youse charged wid
'saulting Dave Carter wid uh dangerous weapon and then stealin his
lawful turkey gobbler. You heard de charge--guilty or not guilty?

JIM
(arrogantly) Yeah, I hit him and I'll hit him agin if he crowd me. But
I ain't guilty uh no crime. (He hitches up his pants and sits down
arrogantly.)

CLARKE
(surprised) Whuts dat you say, Jim? (raps sharply) Git up from there
sir! Whuts dat you say?

JIM
(rising) I say, heah, I lammed ole Dave wid de mule bone, but I ain't
guilty uh nothin.

(There is a stark silence for a few seconds. Then Clarke raps
nervously.)

CLARKE
How come you ain't guilty?

(Jim sits down amid jubilant smiles of Methodists. Simms chuckles out
loud and wipes his face with his handkerchief. He gets to his feet
still gloating.)

SIMMS
(to Jim) Set down, Jim, and lemme show dese people dat walks in de
darkness wid sinners an' republicans de light.

SINGLETARY
You just as well tuh hush up befo' you start, then, Simms. You can't
show nobody uh light when you ain't got none tuh show.

HAMBO
Ain't dat de gospel?

NIXON
Aw, let de man talk. Y'all sound lak uh tree full uh blackbirds. Go
head on, Elder Simms.

WALTER
Yeah, you can't teach 'em nothin' but talk on. We know whut you
talkin' about.

CLARKE
(raps once or twice) I God, tell it. Whut ever tis you got tuh tell.

SISTER LEWIS
An yeah, hurry up and tell it. I know it ain't goin' tuh be nothin'
after you git it told but hurry up and say it so yo' egg-bag kin rest
easy.

WALTER
Aw shut up an' give de man uh chance.

SISTER LEWIS
My shetters ain't workin' good. Sposin' you come shet me up, Walter.
Den you'll know it's done right.

LIGE
Aw, whyn't y'all ack lak folks an' leave de man talk.

CLARKE
(rapping repeatedly) Order in dis court, I God, jus' like you was in
Orlando! (Silence falls.) Now, Simms, talk yo' chat.

SIMMS
(glances down into his open Bible then looks all around the room with
great deliberation. It is evident he enjoys being the center of
attraction. He smiles smugly as he turns his face towards the pulpit.
He speaks slowly and accents his words so that none will be lost on
his audience.) De Bible says, be sho' you're right, then go ahead. (He
looks all around to collect the admiration he feels he has earned.)
Now, we all done gethered and 'sembled here tuh law dis young lad of
uh boy on uh might serious charge. Uh whole passle of us is rarin tuh
drive him way from home lak you done done off his daddy an' his
brothers.

HAMBO
We never drove off his pappy. De white folks took an' hung him for
killin' dat man [Note: corrected missing space?] in Kissimmee for
nothin'.

SIMMS
Dat ain't de point, brother Hambo.

HAMBO
It's jes' as good uh point as any. If you gointer talk--tell de truth.
An if you can't tell de truth, set down an' leave Rev. Singletary
talk.

SIMMS
Brother Mayor, how come you let dese people run they mouf
lak uh passle uh cow-bells? Ain't I got de floor? I ain't no
breath-and-britches. I was _people_ in Middle Georgy befo' I ever come
to Floridy. Whut kind of Chairman is you, nohow?

CLARKE
(angrily) Heah! Heah! Don't you come tryin' show yo'self round me! I
God, I don't keer whut you wuz in Georgy. I God, I kin eat fried
chicken when you [Note: corrected missing spaces] caint git rain water
tuh drink. Hurry up an' say dat mess you got in yo' craw an' set down.
We needs yo' space more than we needs yo' comp'ny.

NIXON
Don't let him skeer you, Elder Sims. You got plenty shoulders tuh back
yo' fallin.

HAMBO
Well, each an' every shoulder kin hit de ground an' I'll git wid 'em.
Don't like it dontcher take, here my collar come an' shake it.

WALTER
Hambo, everybody in Orange County knows you love tuh fight. But dis is
uh law hearin'--not no wrassle.

HAMBO
Oh you Methdis' niggers wants tuh fight bad enough, but youse skeered.
Youse jus' as hot as Tucker when de mule kicked his mammy. But you
know you got plenty coolers.

SISTER TAYLOR
Aw, taint nobody skeered uh you half-pint Baptists. God knows Ahm
ready an' willin'. (She glares at Mrs. Lewis.)

(Sister Lewis jumps to her feet but is pulled back into her seat.
Mayor Clarke raps for order and the room gets quiet.)

CLARKE
Aw right now, Simms. I God, git through.

SIMMS
(pompously) Now, y'all done up an' took dis po' boy an' had him locked
up in uh barn ever since Sat'day night an' done got him 'coused uh
assault an' stealing uh turkey an' I don't know whut all an' you ain't
got no business wid yo' hands on him stell. He ain't done no crime,
an' if y'all knowed anything 'bout law, I wouldn't have tuh tell you so.

CLARKE
I God, he is done uh crime and he's gointer ketch it, too.

SIMMS
But not by law, Brother Mayor. You tryin' tuh lay uh hearin' on dis
boy an' you can't do it cause he ain't broke no law--I don't keer whut
he done so long as he don't break no law you can't tetch him.

SINGLETARY
He committed assault, didn't he? Dat sho is breakin' de law.

SIMMS
Naw, he ain't committed no 'sault. He jus' lammed Dave over de head
an' took his own turkey an' come on home, dat's all. (triumphantly)
Yuh see y'll don't knoww whut you talkin' 'bout. Now, I done set in de
court house an' heard de white folks law from mornin' till night. (He
flips his Bible shut.) I done read dis book from lid tuh lid an' I
knows de law. You got tuh have uh weepon tuh commit uh 'sault. An'
taint in no white folks law an taint in dis Bible dat no mule bone is
no weapon. I

CLARKE
(after a moment of dead silence) I God, whut's dat you say?

SIMMS
(sitting down and crossing his legs and folding his hands upon his
Bible) You heard me. I say you ain't got no case 'ginst dis boy an'
you got tuh turn him go.

SINGLETARY
(jumping up) Brother Chairman--

CLARKE
(raps once and nods recognition) You got de floor.

SINGLETARY
I ain't book-learnt an' I ain't rubbed de hair offen my head agin no
college wall, but I know when uh 'sault been committed. I says Jim
Weston did 'sault Davie. (He points at Dave's head.) An' steal his
turkey. Everybody knows Jim can't hunt wid Dave. An' he 'saulted Dave
too.

SIMMS
(arrogantly) Prove it!

(Singletary stands there silent and puzzled. The Methodist side breaks
into a triumphant shout of "Oh Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan,
Pharaoh's army got drownded." Singletary sinks into his seat. When
they have shouted out three choruses, Simms arises to speak.)

I move dat we sing doxology and bring dis meetin' to uh close. We'se
all workin' people, Brother Mayor. Dismiss us so we kin gwan back to
our work. De sun is two hours high yet. (looks towards the Methodist
side) I move dat we adjourn.

WALTER
I second de motion.

SINGLETARY
(arising slowly) Hold on there uh minute wid dat motion. Dis ain't no
lodge meetin'. Dis is uh court an' bofe sides got uh right tuh talk.
(motions towards Simms' Bible) Youse uh letter learnt man but I kin
read dat Bible some too. Lemme take it uh minute.

SIMMS
I ain't gointer do it. Any preacher dat amounts to uh hill uh beans
would have his own Bible.

CLARKE
I God, Singletary, you right here in yo' own church. Come on up here
an' read out yo' pulpit Bible. I God, don't mind me being up here.
Come on up.

(A great buzzing breaks out all over the church as Singletary mounts
the pulpit. Clarke raps for order. Simms begins to turn the leaves of
the Bible.)

SIMMS
Brother Mayor, you oughter let us outa here. You ain't got no case
'ginst dis boy. Don't waste our time for nothin'. Leave us go home.

CLARKE
Aw, dry up, Simms. You done talked yo' talk. I God, leave Singletary
talk his. (to Singletary) Step on out when you ready, Rev.

REV. SINGLETARY
(Reading) It says here in Judges 18:18 dat Samson slewed three
thousand [Note: corrected missing space] Philistines wid de jawbone of
an ass.

SIMMS
(on his feet) Yeah, but dis wasn't no ass. Dis was uh mule, Brother
Mayor. Dismiss dis meetin' and less all go home.

SINGLETARY
Yeah, but he was half-ass. A ass is uh mule's daddy and he's biggern
uh ass, too. (emphatic gestures) Everybody knows dat--even de lil
chillun.

SIMMS
(standing) Yeah, but we didn't come here to talk about no asses,
neither no half asses, nor no mule daddies. (laughter from de
Methodists) We come to law uh boy for 'sault an' larceny.

SINGLETARY
(very patiently) We'se comin' to dat pint now. Dat's de second claw uh
de sentence wese expoundin'. I say Jim Weston did have uh weepon in
his hand when he 'saulted Dave. Cause y'all knows if de daddy is
dangerous, den de son is dangerous too. An' y'all knows dat de further
back you gits on uh mule de more dangerous he gits an' if de jawbone
slewed three thousand people, by de time you gits back tuh his hocks,
its pizen enough tuh kill ten thousand. Taint no gun in de world ever
kilt dat many mens. Taint no knives nor no razors ever kilt no three
thousand people. Now, folkses, I ast y'all whut kin be mo' dangarous
dan uh mule bone? (to Clarke) Brother Mayor, Jim didn't jes' lam Dave
an walk off. (very emphatic) He 'saulted him wid de deadliest weepon
there is in de world an' while he was layin' unconscious, he stole his
turkey an' went. Brother Mayor, he's uh criminal an' oughter be run
outa dis peaceful town.

(Great chorus of approval from Baptist Clarke begins to rap for
order.)

SIMMS
(attending) Brother Mayor, I object. I have studied jury and I know
what I'm talkin' about.

CLARKE
Aw dry up, Simms. Youse entirely out of order. You may be slick, but
you kin stand another greasing. Rev. Singletary is right. I God, I
knows de law when I hear it. Stand up dere, Jim.

(Jim rises very slowly. Simms rises also.)

CLARKE
Set down, Simms. I God, I know where to find you when I want you.
(Simms sits.) Jim, I find you guilty as charged an' I wants you to git
outa my town and stay gone for two years. (to Lum) Brother Marshall,
you see dat he gits outa town befo' dark. An' you folks dats so
anxious to fight, git on off dis church grounds befo' you start. And
don't use no knives and no guns and no mule bones. Court's dismissed.


_CURTAIN_




ACT III


Scene I


SETTING: Curtain goes up on a stretch of railroad track with a
luxurious Florida forest on the backdrop. Entrances left and right. It
is near sundown.

ACTION: When the curtain goes up there is no one on the stage, but
there is a tremendous noise and hub-bub off stage right. There are
yells of derision, shouts of anger. Part of the mob is trying to keep
Jim in town and a part is driving him off. After a full minute of
this, Jim enters with his guitar hanging around his neck and his coat
over his shoulder. The sun is dropping low and red thru the forest. He
is looking back angrily and shouting back at the mob. A small missile
is thrown after him. Jim drops his coat and guitar and grabs up a
piece of brick and threatens to throw it.

JIM
(Running back the way he came and hurls the brick with all his might.)
I'll kill some of youole box-ankled niggers--(grabs up another piece
of brick) I'm out yo' ole town--now jus' some of you ole half-pint
Baptists let yo' wooden God and Cornstalk Jesus fool you to hit me!
(Threatens to throw. There are some frightened screams and the mob is
heard running back.) I'm glad I'm out yo' ole town, anyhow. I ain't
never comin' back no more, neither. You ole ugly-rump niggers done
ruint de town anyhow.

(There is complete silence off stage. Jim walks a few steps then sits
down on the railroad embankment facing the audience. Jim pulls off one
shoe and pours the sand out. He holds the shoe in his hand a moment
and looks wistfully back down the railroad track.)

JIM
Lawd, folks sho is deceitful. (He puts on the shoe and looks back down
the track again.) I never woulda thought people woulda acted lak dat.
(Laces up the shoe) Specially Dave Carter, much as me an' him done
proaged round together goin' in swimmin' and playin' ball an'
serenadin' de girls an' de white folks.

(He sits there gloomily silent for a while, then looks behind him and
picks up his guitar and begins to pick a tune. It is very sad. He
trails off into "You may leave an' go to Halimuhfack." When he
finishes he looks back at the sun and picks up his coat also.)

I never woulda thought people woulda acted lak dat. (laces up the
shoe) Specially Dave Carter, much as me an' him done proaged round
together, goin' in swimmin' and playin' ball an' serenadin' de girls
an' de white folks. (He sits there gloomily silent for a while then
looks behind him and picks up his guitar and beings to pick a tune. It
is very sad. He trails off into "You may leave and go to Halimuhfack."
When he finishes he looks back at the sun and picks up his coat also.)
(He looks back again towards the village.) Reckon I better git on down
de road an' git somewhere, Lawd knows where. (stops suddenly in his
tracks and turns back towards the village and takes a step or two.)
All dat mess and stink for nothin'. Dave knows good an' well I didn't
mean to hurt him much. (He takes off his cap and scratches his head
thoroughly, then turns again and starts on down the road towards left.
Enter Daisy left walking briskly.)

DAISY
Hello, Jim.

JIM
Hello, Daisy.

(Embarrassed silence)

DAISY
I was just coming over town to see how you come out.

JIM
You don't have to go way over there to find dat out--you and Dave done
got me run outa town for nothin'.

DAISY
(Putting her hand on his arm) Dey didn't run you outa town, did dey?

JIM
(Shaking her hand off) Whut you reckon I'm countin' Mr. Railroad's
ties for--just to find out how many ties between here and Orlando?

DAISY
(Hand on his arm again) Dey _cain't_ run you off like dat!

JIM
Take yo' hands off me, Daisy! How come they can't run me off wid you
and Dave an'--_everybody_ gainst me?

DAISY
I ain't opened my moff 'gainst you, Jim. I ain't said one word--I
wasn't even at de old trial. My madame wouldn't let me git off. I wuz
just comin' to see 'bout you now.

JIM
Aw, go 'head on. You figgered I was gone too long to talk about. You
was haulin' it over to town to see Dave--dat's whut was doin'--after
gittin _me_ all messed up.

DAISY
(Making as if to cry) I wasn't studying 'bout no Dave.

JIM
(Hopefully) Aw, don't tell me. (Sings) Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,
show me a woman that a man can trust.

(Daisy is crying now.)

JIM
Whut you crying for? You know you love Dave. I'm yo' monkey-man. He
always could do more wid you that I could.

DAISY
Naw, you ain't no monkey-man neither. I don't want you to leave town.
I didn't want y'all to be fightin' over me, nohow.

JIM
Aw, rock on down de road wid dat stuff. A two-timing cloaker like you
don't keer whut come off. Me and Dave been good friends ever since we
was born till you had to go flouncing yourself around.

DAISY
What did I do? All I did was to come over town to see you and git a
mouf-ful of gum. Next thing I now y'all is fighting and carrying on.

JIM
(stands silent for a while) Did you come over there Sat'day to see me
sho nuff, sugar babe?

DAISY
Everybody could see dat but you.

JIM
Just like I told you, Daisy. I'll say it before yo' face and behind
yo' back. I could kiss you every day--just as regular as pig-bracks.

DAISY
And I tole you I could stand it too--justa s regular as you could.

JIM
(Catching her by the arm and pulling her down with him onto the rail)
Set, down here, Daisy. Less talk some chat. You want me sho
nuff--honest to God?

DAISY
(coyly) 'Member whut I told you out on de lake last summer?

JIM
Sho nuff, Daisy?

(Daisy nods smilingly.)

JIM
(Sadly) But I got to go 'way. Whut we gointer to 'bout dat?

DAISY
Where you goin', Jim?

JIM
(Looking sadly down the track) God knows.

(Off stage from the same direction from which Jim entered comes the
sound of whistling and tramping of feet on the ties.)

JIM
(Brightening) Dat's Dave! (Frowning suspiciously) Wonder whut he doin'
walking dis track? (Looks accusingly at Daisy) I bet he's goin' to yo'
work-place.

DAISY
Whut for?

JIM
He ain't goin' to see de madame--must be goin' to see you. (He starts
to rise petulantly as Dave comes upon the scene. Daisy rises also.)

DAVE
(Looks accusingly from one to the other) Whut y'all jumpin' up
for? I....

JIM
Whut you got to do wid us business? Tain't none of yo' business if we
stand up, set down or fly like a skeeter hawk.

DAVE
Who said I keered? Dis railroad belongs to de _man_--I kin walk it
good as you, can't I?

JIM
(Laughing exultantly) Oh yeah, Mr. Do-Dirty! You figgered you had done
run me on off so you could git Daisy all by yo'self. You was headin'
right for her work-place.

DAVE
I wasn't no such a thing.

JIM
You was. Didn't I lear you coming down de track all whistling and
everything?

DAVE
Youse a big old Georgy-something-ain't-so! I done got my belly full of
Daisy Sat'day night. She can't snore in my ear no more.

DAISY
(Indignantly) Whut you come here low-rating me for, Dave Carter? I
ain't done nothin' to you but treat you white. Who come rubbed yo' ole
head for you yestiddy if it wasn't me?

DAVE
Yeah, you rubbed my head all right, and I lakted dat. But everybody
say you done toted a pan to Joe Clark's barn for Jim before I seen
you.

DAISY
Think I was going to let Jim there thout nothing fitten for a dog to
eat?

DAVE
That's all right, Daisy. If you want to pay Jim for r knockin' me in
de head, all right. But I'm a man in a class--in a class to myself and
nobody knows my name.

JIM
(Snatching Daisy around to face him) Was you over to Dave's house
yestiddy rubbing his ole head and cloaking wid him to run me outa
town--and me locked up in dat barn wid de cows and mules?

DAISY
(Sobbing) All both of y'all hollerin' at me an' fussin' me just
cause I tries to be nice--and neither one of y'all don't keer
nothin' bout me.

(Both boys glare at each other over Daisy's head and both try to hug
her at the same time. She violently wrenches herself away from both
and makes as if to move on.)

Leave me go! Take yo' rusty pams offen me. I'm going on back to my
work-place. I just got off to see bout y'all and look how y'all
treat me.

JIM
Wait a minute, Daisy. I love you like God loves Gabriel--and dat's His
best angel.

DAVE
Daisy, I love you harder than detthunder can bump a stump--if I
don't--God's a gopher.

DAISY
(Brightening) Dat's de first time you ever said so.

DAVE and JIM
Who?

JIM
Whut you hollering "who" for? Yo' foot don't fit no limb.

DAVE
Speak when you spoken to--come when you called, next fall you'll be my
coon houn' dog.

JIM
Table dat discussion. (Turning to Daisy) You ain't never give me no
chance to talk wid you right.

DAVE
You made _me_ feel like you was trying to put de Ned book on me all de
time. Do you love me sho nuff, Daisy?

DAISY
(Blooming again into coquetry) Aw, y'all better stop dat. You know you
don't mean it.

DAVE
Who don't mean it? Lemme tell you something, mama, if you was mine I
wouldn't have you counting no ties wid yo' pretty lil toes. Know whut
I'd do?

DAISY
(Coyly) Naw, whut would you do?

DAVE
I'd buy a whole passenger train and hire some mens to run it for you.

DAISY
(Happily) Oo-ooh, Dave.

JIM
(to Dave)

  De wind may blow, de door may slam
  Dat whut you shootin' ain't worth a dam.

(to Daisy) I'd buy you a great big ole ship--and then baby, I'd buy
you a ocean to[Note: corrected missing space] sail yo' ship on.

DAISY
(Happily) Oo-ooh, Jim.

DAVE
(to Jim)

  A long train, a short caboose
  Dat lie whut you shootin', ain't no use.

(to Daisy) Miss Daisy, know what I'd do for you?

DAISY
Naw, whut?

DAVE
I'd like uh job cleanin out de Atlantic Ocean jus for you.

DAISY
Don't fool me now, papa.

DAVE
I couldn't fool _you_, Daisy, cause anything I say bout lovin' you, I
don't keer how big it is, it wouldn't be half de truth. Y

DAVE
I'd come down de river riding a mud cat and leading a minnow.

DAISY
Lawd, Dave, you sho is propaganda.

JIM
(Peevishly) Naw he ain't--he's just lying--he's a noble liar. Know
whut I'd do if you was mine?

DAISY
Naw, Jim.

JIM
I'd make a panther wash yo' dishes and a 'gator chop yo' wood for you.

DAVE
Daisy, how come you [Note: corrected missing space] let Jim lie lak
dat? He's as big a liar as he is a [Note: corrected missing space]
man. But sho nuff now, laying all sides to jokes, Jim, there don't
even know how to answer you. If you don't b'lieve it, ast him
something.

DAISY
(to Jim) You like me much, Jim?

JIM
(Enthusiastically) Yeah, Daisy, I sho do.

DAVE
(Triumphant) See dat! I tole you he didn't know how to answer nobocy
like you. If he was talking to some of them ol' funny looking gals
over town he'd be answering 'em just right. But he got to learn how to
answer _you_. Now you ast _me_ something and see how I answer you.

DAISY
Do you like me, Dave?

DAVE
(Very properly in a falsetto voice) Yes ma'am! Dat's de way to answer
swell folks like you. Furthermore, less we prove which one [Note:
corrected missing space] of us love you de best right now. (To Jim)
Jim, how much time owuld you do on de chain-gang for dis 'oman?

JIM
Twenty years and like it.

DAVE
See dat, Daisy? Dat nigger ain't willing to do no time for you. I'd
_beg_ de judge to gimme life. (Both Jim and Dave laugh)

DAISY
Y'all doin' all dis bookooing out here on de railroad track but I bet
y'all crazy 'bout Bootsie and Teets and a whole heap of others.

JIM
Cross my feet and hope to die! I'd ruther see all de other wimmenfolks
in de world dead than for[Note: corrected missing space] you to have de
tooth-ache.

DAVE
If I was dead any any other woman come near my coffin de undertaker
would have to do his job all over--cause I'd git right up and walk
off. Furthermore, Miss Daisy, ma'am, also m'am, which would _you_
ruther be a lark a flying or a dove a settin'--ma'am also ma'am?

DAISY
'Course I'd ruther be a dove.

JIM
Miss Daisy, ma'am, also ma'am--if you marry dis nigger over my head,
I'm going to git me a green hickory club and season it over yo' head.

DAVE
Don't you be skeered, baby--papa kin take keer a _you_. (to Jim)
Counting from de finger (suiting the action to the word) back to the
thumb--start anything I got you some.

JIM
Aw, I don't want no more fight wid you, Dave.

DAVE
Who said anything about fighting? We just provin' who love Daisy de
best. (to Daisy) Now, which one of us you think love you de best?

DAISY
Deed I don't know, Dave.

DAVE
Baby, I'd walk de water for you--and tote a mountain on my head while
I'm walkin'.

JIM
Know whut I'd do, honey babe? If you was a thousand miles from home
and you didn't have no ready-made money and you had to walk all de
way, walkin' till yo' feet start to rolling, just like a wheel, and I
was riding way up in de sky, I'd step backwards offa dat airyplane
just to walk home wid you.

DAISY
(Falling on Jim's neck) Jim, when you talk to me like dat I just can't
stand it. Less us git married right now.

JIM
Now you talkin' like a blue-back speller. Less go!

DAVE
(Sadly) You gointer leave me lak dis, Daisy?

DAISY
(Sadly) I likes you, too, Dave, I sho do. But I can't marry both of
y'all at de same time.

JIM
Aw, come on, Daisy--sun's gettin' low. (He starts off pulling Daisy.)

DAVE
Whut's I'm gointer do? (Walking after them)

JIM
Gwan back and hunt turkeys--you make out you so touchous nobody can't
tell you yo' eye is black thout you got to run git de law.

DAVE
(Almost tearfully) Aw Jim, shucks! Where y'all going?

(Daisy comes to an abrupt halt and stops Jim)

DAISY
That's right, Honey. Where _is_ we goin' sho nuff?

JIM (Sadly)
Deed I don't know, baby. They just sentenced [Note: corrected missing
space] me to go--they didn't say where and I don't know.

DAISY
How we goin' know how to go when [Note: corrected missing space] we
don't know where we goin'?

(Jim looks at Dave as if he expects some help but Dave stands sadly
silent. Jim takes a few steps forward as if to go on. Daisy makes a
step or two, unwillingly, then looks behind her and stops. Dave looks
as if he will follow them.)

DAISY
Jim! (He stops and turns) Wait a minute! Whut we gointer do when we
git there?

JIM
Where?

DAISY
Where we goin'?

JIM
I done tole you I don't know where it is.

DAISY
But how we gointer git something to eat and a place to stay?

JIM
Play my box for de white folks and dance just like I been doing.

DAISY
You can't take keer of me on dat, not where we hafta pay rent.

JIM
(Looks appealingly at Dave, then away quickly) Well, I can't help
_dat_, can I?

DAISY
(Brightly) I tell you whut, Jim! Less us don't go nowhere. They
sentenced you to leave Eatonville and youse almost a mile from de city
limits already. Youse in Maitland now. Supposin' you come live on de
white folks' place wid me after we git married. Eatonville ain't got
nothin' to do wid you livin' in Maitland.

JIM
Dat's a good idea, Daisy.

DAISY
(Jumping into his arms) And lissen, honey, you don't have to be
beholden to nobody. You can throw dat ole box away if you want to. I
know where you can get a _swell_ job.

JIM
(Sheepishly) Doin' whut? (Looks lovingly at his guitar)

DAISY
(Almost dancing) Yard man. All you have to do is wash windows, and
sweep de sidewalk, and scrub off de steps and porch and hoe up de
weeds and rake up de leaves and dig a few holes now and then with a
spade--to plant some trees and things like that. It's a good steady
job.

JIM
(After a long deliberation) You see, Daisy, de mayor and corporation
told me to go on off and I oughter go.

DAISY
Well, I'm not going tippin' down no railroad track like a Maltese cat.
I wasn't brought up knockin' round from here to yonder.

JIM
Well, I wasn't brought up wid no spade in my hand--and ain't going to
start it now.

DAISY
But sweetheart, we got to live, ain't we? We got to git hold of money
before we kin do anything. I don't mean to stay in de white folks'
kitchen all my days.

JIM
Yeah, all dat's true, but you couldn't buy a flea a waltzing jacket
wid de money _I'm_ going to make wid a hoe and spade.

DAISY
(Getting tearful) You don't want me. You don't love me.

JIM
Yes, I do, darling, I love you. Youse de one letting a spade come
between us. (He caresses her.) I loves you and you only. You don't see
_me_ dragging a whole gang of farming tools into us business, do you?

DAISY
(stiffly) Well, I ain't going to marry no man that ain't going to work
and take care of me.

JIM
I don't mind working if de job ain't too heavy for me. I ain't going
to bother wid nothin' in my hands heavier than dis box--and I totes it
round my neck 'most of de time. I kin go out and hunt you some game
when times gits tight.

DAISY
Don't strain yo'self huntin' nothin' for me. I ain't goin' to eat
nobody's settin' hen. (She turns to DAVE finally.)

JIM
Whut ole sittin hen? Ain't you and Lum done et up de turkey
I--I--bought?

DAISY
You might of brought it, but Dave sho kilt it. You couldn't hit de
side of uh barn wid uh bass fiddle.

DAVE
Course I kilt it, and I kilt it for you, but I didn't kill none for
Lum Boger. De clean head hound!

(Daisy turns to Dave finally)

DAISY
Well, I reckon you loves me the best anyhow. You wouldn't talk to me
like Jim did, would you, Dave?

DAVE
Naw, I wouldn't say whut he said a-tall.

DAISY
(Cuddling up to him) Whut would _you_ say, honey?

DAVE
I'd say dat box was too heavy for me to fool wid. I wouldn't tote
nothing my gun and my hat and I feel like I'm 'busing myself sometie
totin' dat.

DAISY
(Outraged) Don't you mean to work none?

DAVE
Wouldn't hit a lick at a snake.

DAISY
I don't blame _you_, Dave (looks down at his feet) cause toting dem
feet of yourn is enough to break down your constitution.

DAVE
They carries me wherever I wants to go. Daisy, you marry Jim cause I
don't want to come between y'all. He's my buddy.

JIM
Come to think of it, Dave, she was yourn first. You take and handle
dat spade for her.

DAVE
You heard her say it is all I can do to lift up dese feets and put 'em
down. Where I'm going to git any time to wrassle wid any hoes and
shovels? You kin git round better'n me. You done won Daisy--I give in.
I ain't going to bite no friend of mine in de back.

DAISY
Both of you niggers can git yo' hat en' yo' heads an' git on down de
road. Neither one of y'all don't have to have me. I got a good job and
plenty men begging for yo' chance.

JIM
Dat's right, Daisy, you go git you one them mens whut don't mind
smelling mules--and beating de white folks to de barn every morning. I
don't wanta be bothered wid nothin' but dis box.

DAVE
And I can't strain wid nothin' but my feets and my gun. I kin git mo'
turkey gobblers, but never no job.

(Daisy walks slowly away in the direction from which she came. Both
watch her a little wistfully for a minute. The sun is setting.)

DAVE
Guess I better be gitin' on back--it's most dark. Where you goin, Jim?

JIM
I don't know, Dave. Down de road, I reckon.

DAVE
Whyncher come on back to town? Taint no use you proagin' up and down
[Note: corrected missing space] de railroad track when you got a home.

JIM
They done lawed me way from it for hittin' you wid dat bone.

DAVE
Dat ain't nothin'. It was my head you hit. An' if I don't keer whut
dem ole ugly-rump niggers got to do wid it?

JIM
They might not let me come in town.

DAVE
(Seizing Jim's arm and facing him back toward the town.) They better!
Look here, Jim, if they try to keep you out dat town we'll go out to
dat swamp and git us a mule bone a piece and come back and boil dat
stew down to a low gravy.

JIM
You mean dat Dave? (Dave nods his head eagerly.)

DAVE
Us wasn't mad wid one 'nother nohow. Come on less go back to town. Dem
mullet heads better leave me be, too. (Picks up a heavy stick) I wish
Lum would come tellin' me bout de law when I got all dis law in _my_
hands. An' de rest of dem 'gator-face jigs--if they ain't got a whole
set of mule bones and a good determination they better not bring de
mess up.

ACT I


SETTING: The raised porch of JOE CLARK'S Store and the street in
front. Porch stretches almost completely across the stage, with a
plank bench at either end. At the center of the porch three steps
leading from street. Rear of porch, center, door to the store. On
either side are single windows on which signs, at left, "POST OFFICE",
and at right, "GENERAL STORE" are painted. Soap boxes, axe handles,
small kegs, etc., on porch on which townspeople sit and lounge during
action. Above the roof of the porch the "false front", or imitation
second story of the shop is seen with large sign painted across it
"JOE CLARK'S GENERAL STORE". Large kerosine street lamp on post at
right in front of porch.

Saturday afternoon and the villagers are gathered around the store.
Several men sitting on boxes at edge of porch chewing sugar cane,
spitting tobacco juice, arguing, some whittling, others eating
peanuts. During the act the women all dressed up in starched dresses
parade in and out of store. People buying groceries, kids playing in
the street, etc. General noise of conversation, laughter and children
shouting. But when the curtain rises there is momentary lull for
cane-chewing. At left of porch four men are playing cards on a soap
box, and seated on the edge of the porch at extreme right two children
are engaged in a checker game, with the board on the floor between
them.

When the curtain goes up the following characters are discovered on
the porch: MAYOR JOE CLARK, the storekeeper; DEACON HAMBO; DEACON
GOODWIN; Old Man MATT BRAZZLE; WILL CODY; SYKES JONES; LUM BOGER, the
young town marshall; LIGE MOSELY and WALTER THOMAS, two village wags;
TOM NIXON and SAM MOSELY, and several others, seated on boxes, kegs,
benches and floor of the porch. TONY TAYLOR is sitting on steps of
porch with empty basket. MRS. TAYLOR comes out with her arms full of
groceries, empties them into basket and goes back in store. All the
men are chewing sugar cane earnestly with varying facial expressions.
The noise of the breaking and sucking of cane can be clearly heard in
the silence. Occasionally the laughter and shouting of children is
heard nearby off stage.

HAMBO: (To BRAZZLE) Say, Matt, gimme a jint or two of dat green
cane--dis ribbon cane is hard.

LIGE: Yeah, and you ain't got de chears in yo' parlor you useter have.

HAMBO: Dat's all right, Lige, but I betcha right now wid dese few
teeth I got I kin eat up more cane'n you kin grow.

LIGE: I know you kin and that's de reason I ain't going to tempt you.
But youse gettin' old in lots of ways--look at dat bald-head--just as
clean as my hand. (Exposes his palm).

HAMBO: Don't keer if it tis--I don't want nothin'--not even
hair--between me and God. (General laughter--LIGE joins in as well.
Cane chewing keeps up. Silence for a moment.)

(Off stage a high shrill voice can be heard calling:)

VOICE: Sister Mosely, Oh, Sister Mosely! (A pause) Miz Mosely! (Very
irritated) Oh, Sister Mattie! You hear me out here--you just won't
answer!

VOICE OF MRS. MOSELY: Whoo-ee ... somebody calling me?

VOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Angrily) Never mind now--you couldn't come
when I called you. I don't want yo' lil ole weasley turnip greens.
(Silence)

MATT BRAZZLE: Sister Roberts is en town agin! If she was mine, I'll
be hen-fired if I wouldn't break her down in de lines (loins)--good as
dat man is to her!

HAMBO: I wish she was mine jes' one day--de first time she open her
mouf to beg _anybody_, I'd lam her wid lightning.

JOE CLARK: I God, Jake Roberts buys mo' rations out dis store than any
man in dis town. I don't see to my Maker whut she do wid it all....
Here she come....

(ENTER MRS. JAKE ROBERTS, a heavy light brown woman with a basket on
her arm. A boy about ten walks beside her carrying a small child about
a year old straddle of his back. Her skirts are sweeping the ground.
She walks up to the step, puts one foot upon the steps and looks
forlornly at all the men, then fixes her look on JOE CLARK.)

MRS. ROBERTS: Evenin', Brother Mayor.

CLARK: Howdy do, Mrs. Roberts. How's yo' husband?

MRS. ROBERTS: (Beginning her professional whine): He ain't much and I
ain't much and my chillun is poly. We ain't got 'nough to eat! Lawd,
Mr. Clark, gimme a lil piece of side meat to cook us a pot of greens.

CLARK: Aw gwan, Sister Roberts. You got plenty bacon home. Last week
Jake bought....

MRS. ROBERTS: (Frantically) Lawd, Mist' Clark, how long you think dat
lil piece of meat last me an' my chillun? Lawd, me and my chillun is
_hongry_! God knows, Jake don't fee-eed me!

(MR. CLARK sits unmoved. MRS. ROBERTS advances upon him)

Mist' Clark!

CLARK: I God, woman, don't keep on after me! Every time I look, youse
round here beggin' for everything you see.

LIGE: And whut she don't see she whoops for it just de same.

MRS. ROBERTS: (In dramatic begging pose) Mist' Clark! Ain't you boin'
do nuthin' for me? And you see me and my poor chillun is starvin'....

CLARK: (Exasperated rises) I God, woman, a man can't git no peace wid
somebody like you in town. (He goes angrily into the store followed by
MRS. ROBERTS. The boy sits down on the edge of the porch sucking the
baby's thumb.)

VOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: A piece 'bout dis wide....

VOICE OF CLARK: I God, naw! Yo' husband done bought you plenty meat,
nohow.

VOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (In great anguish) Ow! Mist' Clark! Don't you
cut dat lil tee-ninchy piece of meat for me and my chillun! (Sound of
running feet inside the store.) I ain't a going to tetch it!

VOICE OF CLARK: Well, don't touch it then. That's all you'll git outa
me.

VOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Calmer) Well, hand it chear den. Lawd, me and
my chillun is _so_ hongry.... Jake don't fee-eed me. (She re-enters by
door of store with the slab of meat in her hand and an outraged look
on her face. She gazes all about her for sympathy.) Lawd, me and my
poor chillun is _so_ hongry ... and some folks has _every_thing and
they's so _stingy_ and gripin'.... Lawd knows, Jake don't fee-eed me!
(She exits right on this line followed by the boy with the baby on his
back.)

(All the men gaze behind her, then at each other and shake their
heads.)

HAMBO: Poor Jak.... I'm really sorry for dat man. If she was mine I'd
beat her till her ears hung down like a Georgy mule.

WALTER THOMAS: I'd beat her till she smell like onions.

LIGE: I'd romp on her till she slack like lime.

NIXON: I'd stomp her till she rope like okra.

VOICE OF MRS. ROBERTS: (Off stage right) Lawd, Miz Lewis, you goin'
give me dat lil han'ful of greens for me and my chillun. Why dat ain't
a eye-full. I ought not to take 'em ... but me and my chillun is _so_
hongry.... Some folks is so stingy and gripin'! Lawd knows, Tony don't
_feed_ me!

(The noise of cane-chewing is heard again. Enter JOE LINDSAY left with
a gun over his shoulder and the large leg bone of a mule in the other
hand. He approaches the step wearily.)

HAMBO: Well, did you git any partridges, Joe?

JOE: (Resting his gun and seating himself) Nope, but I made de
feathers fly.

HAMBO: I don't see no birds.

JOE: Oh, the feathers flew off on de birds.

LIGE: I don't see nothin' but dat bone. Look lak you done kilt a cow
and et 'im raw out in de woods.

JOE: Don't y'all know dat hock-bone?

WALTER: How you reckon we gointer know every hock-bone in Orange
County sight unseen?

JOE: (Standing the bone up on the floor of the porch) Dis is a
hock-bone of Brazzle's ole yaller mule.

(General pleased interest. Everybody wants to touch it.)

BRAZZLE: (Coming forward) Well, sir! (Takes bone in both hands and
looks up and down the length of it) If 'tain't my ole mule! This sho
was one hell of a mule, too. He'd fight every inch in front of de
plow ... he'd turn over de mowing machine ... run away wid de
wagon ... and you better not look like you wanter _ride_ 'im!

LINDSAY: (Laughing) Yeah, I 'member seein' you comin' down de road
just so ... (He limps wid one hand on his buttocks) one day.

BRAZZLE: Dis mule was so evil he used to try to bite and kick when I'd
go in de stable to feed 'im.

WALTER: He was too mean to git fat. He was so skinny you could do a
week's washing on his ribs for a washboard and hang 'em up on his
hip-bones to dry.

LIGE: I 'member one day, Brazzle, you sent yo' boy to Winter Park
after some groceries wid a basket. So here he went down de road ridin'
dis mule wid dis basket on his arm.... Whut you reckon dat ole
contrary mule done when he got to dat crooked place in de road going
round Park Lake? He turnt right round and went through de handle of
dat basket ... wid de boy still up on his back. (General laughter)

BRAZZLE: Yeah, he up and died one Sat'day just for spite ... but he
was too contrary to lay down on his side like a mule orter and die
decent. Naw, he made out to lay down on his narrer contracted back and
die wid his feets sticking straight up in de air just so. (He gets
down on his back and illustrates.) We drug him out to de swamp wid 'im
dat way, didn't we, Hambo?

JOE CLARK: I God, Brazzle, we all seen it. Didn't we all go to de
draggin' out? More folks went to yo' mule's draggin' out than went to
last school closing.... Bet there ain't been a thing right in
mule-hell for four years.

HAMBO: Been dat long since he been dead?

CLARK: I God, yes. He died de week after I started to cutting' dat new
ground.

(The bone is passing from hand to hand. At last a boy about twelve
takes it. He has just walked up and is proudly handling the bone when
a woman's voice is heard off stage right.)

VOICE: Senator! Senator!! Oh, you Senator?

BOY: (Turning displeased mutters) Aw, shux. (Loudly) Ma'm?

VOICE: If you don't come here you better!

SENATOR: Yes ma'am. (He drops bone on ground down stage and trots off
frowning.) Soon as we men git to doing something dese wimmen....
(Exits, right.)

(Enter TEET and BOOTSIE left, clean and primped in voile dresses just
alike. They speak diffidently and enter store. The men admire them
casually.)

LIGE: Them girls done turned out to be right good-looking.

WALTER: Teet ain't as pretty now as she was a few years back. She used
to be fat as a butter ball wid legs just like two whiskey-kegs. She's
too skinny since she got her growth.

CODY: Ain't none of 'em pretty as dat Miss Daisy. God! She's pretty as
a speckled pup.

LIGE: But she was sho nuff ugly when she was little ... little ole
hard black knot. She sho has changed since she been away up North. If
she ain't pretty now, there ain't a hound dog in Georgy.

(Re-enter SENATOR BAILEY and stops on the steps. He addresses JOE
CLARK.)

SENATOR: Mist' Clark....

HAMBO: (To Senator) Ain't you got no manners? We all didn't sleep wid
you last night.

SENATOR: (Embarrassed) Good evening, everybody.

ALL THE MEN: Good evening, son, boy, Senator, etc.

SENATOR: Mist' Clark, mama said is Daisy been here dis evenin'?

JOE CLARK: Ain't laid my eyes on her. Ain't she working over in
Maitland?

SENATOR: Yessuh ... but she's off today and mama sent her down here to
get de groceries.

JOE CLARK: Well, tell yo' ma I ain't seen her.

SENATOR: Well, she say to tell you when she come, to tell her ma say
she better git home and dat quick.

JOE CLARK: I will. (Exit BOY right.)

LIGE: Bet she's off somewhere wid Dave or Jim.

WALTER: I don't bet it ... I know it. She's got them two in de
go-long.

(Re-enter TEET and BOOTSIE from store. TEET has a letter and BOOTSIE
two or three small parcels. The men look up with interest as they come
out on the porch.)

WALTER: (Winking) Whut's dat you got, Teet ... letter from Dave?

TEET: (Flouncing) Naw indeed! It's a letter from my B-I-T-sweetie!
(Rolls her eyes and hips.)

WALTER: (Winking) Well, ain't Dave yo' B-I-T-sweetie? I thought y'all
was 'bout to git married. Everywhere I looked dis summer 'twas you and
Dave, Bootsie and Jim. I thought all of y'all would've done jumped
over de broomstick by now.

TEET: (Flourishing letter) Don't tell it to me ... tell it to the
ever-loving Mr. Albert Johnson way over in Apopka.

BOOTSIE: (Rolling her eyes) Oh, tell 'em 'bout the ever-loving Mr.
Jimmy Cox from Altamont. Oh, I can't stand to see my baby lose.

HAMBO: It's lucky y'all girls done got some more fellers, cause look
like Daisy done treed both Jim and Dave at once, or they done treed
here one.

TEET: Let her have 'em ... nobody don't keer. They don't handle de "In
God we trust" lak my Johnson. He's head bellman at de hotel.

BOOTSIE: Mr. Cox got money's grandma and old grandpa change. (The
girls exit huffily.)

LINDSAY: (To HAMBO, pseudo-seriously) You oughtn't tease dem gals lak
dat.

HAMBO: Oh, I laks to see gals all mad. But dem boys is crazy sho nuff.
Before Daisy come back here they both had a good-looking gal a piece.
Now they 'bout to fall out and fight over half a gal a piece. Neither
one won't give over and let de other one have her.

LIGE: And she ain't thinking too much 'bout no one man. (Looks off
left.) Here she come now. God! She got a mean walk on her!

WALTER: Yeah, man. She handles a lot of traffic! Oh, mama, throw it in
de river ... papa'll come git it!

LINDSAY: Aw, shut up, you married men!

LIGE: Man don't go blind cause he gits married, do he? (Enter DAISY
hurriedly. Stops at step a moment. She is dressed in sheer organdie,
white shoes and stockings.)

DAISY: Good evening, everybody. (Walks up on the porch.)

ALL THE MEN: (Very pleasantly) Good evening, Miss Daisy.

DAISY: (To CLARK) Mama sent me after some meal and flour and some
bacon and sausage oil.

CLARK: Senator been here long time ago hunting you.

DAISY: (Frightened) Did he? Oo ... Mist' Clark, hurry up and fix it
for me. (She starts on in the store.)

LINDSAY: (Giving her his seat) You better wait here, Daisy.

(WALTER kicks LIGE to call his attention to LINDSAY'S attitude)

It's powerful hot in dat store. Lemme run fetch 'em out to you.

LIGE: (To LINDSAY) _Run!_ Joe Lindsay, you ain't been able to run
since de big bell rung. Look at dat gray beard.

LINDSAY: Thank God, I ain't gray all over. I'm just as good a man
right now as any of you young 'uns. (He hurries on into the store.)

WALTER: Daisy, where's yo' two body guards? It don't look natural to
see you thout nary one of 'em.

DAISY: (Archly) I ain't got no body guards. I don't know what you
talkin' about.

LIGE: Aw, don' try to come dat over us, Daisy. You know who we talkin'
'bout all right ... but if you want me to come out flat footed ...
where's Jim and Dave?

DAISY: Ain't they playin' somewhere for de white folks?

LIGE: (To WALTER) Will you listen at dis gal, Walter? (To DAISY) When
I ain't been long seen you and Dave going down to de Lake.

DAISY: (Frightened) Don't y'all run tell mama where I been.

WALTER: Well, you tell us which one you laks de best and we'll wipe
our mouf (Gesture) and say nothin'. Dem boys been de best of friends
all they life, till both of 'em took after you ... then good-bye, Katy
bar de door!

DAISY: (Affected innocence) Ain't they still playin' and dancin'
together?

LIGE: Yeah, but that's 'bout all they do 'gree on these days. That's
de way it is wid men, young and old.... I don't keer how long they
been friends and how thick they been ... a woman kin come between 'em.
David and Jonather never would have been friends so long if Jonather
had of been any great hand wid de wimmen. You ain't never seen no two
roosters that likes one another.

DAISY: I ain't tried to break 'em up.

WALTER: Course you ain't. You don't have to. All two boys need to do
is to git stuck on de same girl and they done broke up ... _right
now_! Wimmen is something can't be divided equal.

(Re-enter JOE LINDSAY and CLARK with the groceries. DAISY jumps up and
grabs the packages.)

LIGE: (To DAISY) Want some of us ... me ... to go long and tote yo'
things for you?

DAISY: (Nervously) Naw, mama is riding her high horse today. Long as I
been gone it wouldn't do for me to come walking up wid nobody. (She
exits hurriedly right.)

(All the men watch her out of sight in silence.)

CLARK: (Sighing) I God, know whut Daisy puts me in de mind of?

HAMBO: No, what? (They all lean together.)

CLARK: I God, a great big mango ... a sweet smell, you know, Th a
strong flavor, but not something you could mash up like a strawberry.
Something with a body to it.

(General laughter, but not obscene.)

HAMBO: (Admiringly) Joe Clark! I didn't know you had it in you!

(MRS. CLARK enters from store door and they all straighten up
guiltily)

CLARK: (Angrily to his wife) Now whut do you want? I God, the minute I
set down, here you come....

MRS. CLARK: Somebody want a stamp, Jody. You know you don't 'low me to
bove wid de post office. (HE rises sullenly and goes inside the
store.)

BRAZZLE: Say, Hambo, I didn't see you at our Sunday School picnic.

HAMBO: (Slicing some plug-cut tobacco) Nope, wan't there dis time.

WALTER: Looka here, Hambo. Y'all Baptist carry dis close-communion
business too far. If a person ain't half drownded in de lake and half
et up by alligators, y'all think he ain't baptized, so you can't take
communion wid him. Now I reckon you can't even drink lemonade and eat
chicken perlow wid us.

HAMBO: My Lord, boy, youse just _full_ of words. Now, in de first
place, if this year's picnic was lak de one y'all had last year ...
you ain't had no lemonade for us Baptists to turn down. You had a big
ole barrel of rain water wid about a pound of sugar in it and one
lemon cut up over de top of it.

LIGE: Man, you sho kin mold 'em!

WALTER: Well, I went to de Baptist picnic wid my mouf all set to eat
chicken, when lo and behold y'all had chitlings! Do Jesus!

LINDSAY: Hold on there a minute. There was plenty chicken at dat
picnic, which I do know is right.

WALTER: Only chicken I seen was half a chicken yo' pastor musta tried
to swaller whole cause he was choked stiff as a board when I come
long ... wid de whole deacon's board beating him in de back, trying
to knock it out his throat.

LIGE: Say, dat puts me in de mind of a Baptist brother that was crazy
'bout de preachers and de preacher was crazy 'bout feeding his face.
So his son got tired of trying to beat dese stump-knockers to de grub
on the table, so one day he throwed out some slams 'bout dese
preachers. Dat made his old man mad, so he tole his son to git out.
He boy ast him "Where must I go, papa?" He says, "Go on to hell I
reckon ... I don't keer where you go."

So de boy left and was gone seven years. He come back one cold, windy
night and rapped on de door. "Who dat?" de old man ast him "It's me,
Jack." De old man opened de door, so glad to see his son agin, and
tole Jack to come in. He did and looked all round de place. Seven or
eight preachers was sitting round de fire eatin' and drinkin'.

"Where you been all dis time, Jack?" de old man ast him.

"I been to hell," Jack tole him.

"Tell us how it is down there, Jack."

"Well," he says, "It's just like it is here ... you cain't git to de
fire for de preachers."

HAMBO: Boy, you kin lie just like de cross-ties from Jacksonville to
Key West. De presidin' elder must come round on his circuit teaching
y'all how to tell 'em, cause you couldn't lie dat good just natural.

WALTER: Can't nobody beat Baptist folks lying ... and I ain't never
found out how come you think youse so important.

LINDSAY: Ain't we got de finest and de biggest church? Macedonia
Baptist will hold more folks than any two buildings in town.

LIGE: Thass right, y'all got a heap more church than you got members
to go in it.

HAMBO: Thass all right ... y'all ain't got neither de church nor de
members. Everything that's had in this town got to be held in our
church.

(Re-enter JOE CLARK.)

CLARK: What you-all talkin'?

HAMBO: Come on out, Tush Hawg, lemme beat you some checkers. I'm tired
of fending and proving wid dese boys ain't got no hair on they chest
yet.

CLARK: I God, you mean you gointer get beat. You can't handle me ...
I'm a tush hawg.

HAMBO: Well, I'm going to draw dem tushes right now. (To two small
boys using checker board on edge of porch.) Here you chilluns, let de
Mayor and me have that board. Go on out an' play an' give us grown
folks a little peace. (The children go down stage and call out:)

SMALL BOY: Hey, Senator. Hey, Marthy. Come on let's play chick-me,
chick-me, cranie-crow.

CHILD'S VOICE: (Off stage) All right! Come on, Jessie! (Enter several
children, led by SENATOR, and a game begins in front of the store as
JOE CLARK and HAMBO play checkers.)

JOE CLARK: I God! Hambo, you can't play no checkers.

HAMBO: (As they seat themselves at the check board) Aw, man, if you
wasn't de Mayor I'd beat you all de time.

(The children get louder and louder, drowning out the men's voices.)

SMALL GIRL: I'm gointer be de hen.

BOY: And I'm gointer be de hawk. Lemme git maself a stick to mark wid.

(The boy who is the hawk squats center stage with a short twig in his
hand. The largest girl lines up the other children behind her.)

GIRL: (Mother Hen) (Looking back over her flock): Y'all ketch holt of
one 'Nother's clothes so de hawk can't git yuh. (They do.) You all
straight now?

CHILDREN: Yeah. (The march around the hawk commences.)

HEN AND CHICKS:
  Chick mah chick mah craney crow
  Went to de well to wash ma toe
  When I come back ma chick was gone
  What time, ole witch?

HAWK: (Making a tally on the ground) One!

HEN AND CHICKS: (Repeat song and march.)

HAWK: (Scoring again) Two!

(Can be repeated any number of times.)

HAWK: Four. (He rises and imitates a hawk flying and trying to catch a
chicken. Calling in a high voice:) Chickee.

HEN: (Flapping wings to protect her young) My chickens sleep.

HAWK: Chickee. (During all this the hawk is feinting and darting in
his efforts to catch a chicken, and the chickens are dancing
defensively, the hen trying to protect them.)

HEN: My chicken's sleep.

HAWK: I shall have a chick.

HEN: You shan't have a chick.

HAWK: I'm goin' home. (Flies off)

HEN: Dere's de road.

HAWK: My pot's a boilin'.

HEN: Let it boil.

HAWK: My guts a growlin'.

HEN: Let 'em growl.

HAWK: I must have a chick.

HEN: You shan't have n'airn.

HAWK: My mama's sick.

HEN: Let her die.

HAWK: Chickie!

HEN: My chicken's sleep.

(HAWK darts quickly around the hen and grabs a chicken and leads him
off and places his captive on his knees at the store porch. After a
brief bit of dancing he catches another, then a third, etc.)

HAMBO: (At the checker board, his voice rising above the noise of the
playing children, slapping his sides jubilantly) Ha! Ha! I got you
now. Go ahead on and move, Joe Clark ... jus' go ahead on and move.

LOUNGERS: (Standing around two checker players) Ol' Deacon's got you
now.

ANOTHER VOICE: Don't see how he can beat the Mayor like that.

ANOTHER VOICE: Got him in the Louisville loop. (These remarks are
drowned by the laughter of the playing children directly in front of
the porch. MAYOR JOE CLARK disturbed in his concentration on the
checkers and peeved at being beaten suddenly turns toward the
children, throwing up his hands.)

CLARK: Get on 'way from here, you limbs of Satan, making all that
racket so a man can't hear his ears. Go on, go on!

(THE MAYOR looks about excitedly for the town marshall. Seeing him
playing cards on the other side of porch, he bellows:)

Lum Boger, whyn't you git these kids away from here! What kind of a
marshall is you? All this passle of young'uns around here under grown
people's feet, creatin' disorder in front of my store.

(LUM BOGER puts his cards down lazily, comes down stage and scatters
the children away. One saucy little girl refuses to move.)

LUM BOGER: Why'nt you go on away from here, Matilda? Didn't you hear
me tell you-all to move?

LITTLE MATILDA: (Defiantly) I ain't goin' nowhere. You ain't none of
my mama. (Jerking herself free from him as LUM touches her.) My mama
in the store and she told me to wait out here. So take that, ol' Lum.

LUM BOGER: You impudent little huzzy, you! You must smell yourself ...
youse so fresh.

MATILDA: The wind musta changed and you smell your own top lip.

LUM BOGER: Don't make me have to grab you and take you down a
buttonhole lower.

MATILDA: (Switching her little head) Go ahead on and grab me. You sho
can't kill me, and if you kill me, you sho can't eat me. (She marches
into the store.)

SENATOR: (Derisively from behind stump) Ol' dumb Lum! Hey! Hey!

(LITTLE BOY at edge of stage thumbs his nose at the marshall.)

(LUM lumbers after the small boy. Both exit.)

HAMBO: (To CLARK who has been thinking all this while what move to
make) You ain't got but one move ... go ahead on and make it. What's
de matter, Mayor?

CLARK: (Moving his checker) Aw, here.

HAMBO: (Triumphant) Now! Look at him, boys. I'm gonna laugh in notes.
(Laughing to the scale and jumping a checker each time) Do, sol, fa,
me, lo ... one! (Jumping another checker) La, sol, fa, me, do ... two!
(Another jump.) Do sol, re, me, lo ... three! (Jumping a third.) Lo
sol, fa, me, re ... four! (The crowd begins to roar with laughter. LUM
BOGER returns, looking on. Children come drifting back again playing
chick-me-chick-me-cranie crow.)

VOICE: Oh, ha! Done got the ol' tush hog.

ANOTHER VOICE: Thought you couldn't be beat, Brother Mayor?

CLARK: (Peeved, gets up and goes into the store mumbling) Oh, I coulda
beat you if I didn't have this store on my mind. Saturday afternoon
and I got work to do. Lum, ain't I told you to keep them kids from
playin' right in front of this store?

(LUM makes a pass at the nearest half-grown boy. The kids dart around
him teasingly.)

ANOTHER VOICE: Eh, heh.... Hambo done run him on his store ... done
run the ol' coon in his hole.

ANOTHER VOICE: That ain't good politics, Hambo, beatin' the Mayor.

ANOTHER VOICE: Well, Hambo, you don't got to be so hard at checkers,
come on let's see what you can do with de cards. Lum Boger there got
his hands full nursin' the chilluns.

ANOTHER VOICE: (At the table) We ain't playin' for money, nohow,
Deacon. We just playin' a little Florida Flip.

HAMBO: Ya all can't play no Florida Flip. When I was a sinner there
wasn't a man in this state could beat me playin' that game. But I'm a
deacon in Macedonia Baptist now and I don't bother with the cards no
more.

VOICE AT CARD TABLE: All right, then, come on here Tony (To man with
basket on steps.) let me catch your jack.

TAYLOR: (Looking toward door) I don't reckon I got time. I guess my
wife gonna get through buying out that store some time or other and
want to go home.

OLD MAN: (On opposite side of porch from card game) I bet my wife
would know better than expect me to sit around and wait for her with a
basket. Whyn't you tell her to tote it on home herself?

TAYLOR: (Sighing and shaking his head.) Eh, Lawd!

VOICE AT CARD TABLE: Look like we can't get nobody to come into this
game. Seem like everybody's scared a us. Come on back here, Lum, and
take your hand. (LUM makes a final futile gesture at the children.)

LUM: Ain't I tole you little haitians to stay away from here?

(CHILDREN scatter teasingly only to return to their play in front of
the store later on. LUM comes up on the porch and re-joins the card
game. Just as he gets seated, MRS. CLARK comes to the door of the
store and calls him.)

MRS. CLARK: (Drawlingly) Columbus!

LUM: (Wearily) Ma'am?

MRS. CLARK: De Mayor say for you to go round in de back yard and tie
up old lady Jackson's mule what's trampin' aup all de tomatoes in my
garden.

LUM: All right. (Leaving card game.) Wait till I come back, folkses.

LIGE: Oh, hum! (Yawning and putting down the deck of cards) Lum's sho
a busy marshall. Say, ain't Dave and Jim been round here yet? I feel
kinder like hearin' a little music 'bout now.

BOY: Naw, they ain't been here today. You-all know they ain't so thick
nohow as they was since Daisy Bailey come back and they started
runnin' after her.

WOMAN: You mean since she started runnin' after them, the young hussy.

MRS. CLARK: (In doorway) She don't mean 'em no good.

WALTER: That's a shame, ain't it now? (Enter LUM from around back of
store. He jumps on the porch and takes his place at the card box.)

LUM: (To the waiting players) All right, boys! Turn it on and let the
bad luck happen.

LIGE: My deal. (He begins shuffling the cards with an elaborate
fan-shape movement.)

VOICE AT TABLE: Look out there, Lige, you shuffling mighty lot. Don't
carry the cub to us.

LIGE: Aw, we ain't gonna cheat you ... we gonna beat you. (He slams
down the cards for LUM BOGER to cut.) Wanta cut 'em?

LUM: No, ain't no need of cutting a rabbit out when you can twist him
out. Deal 'em. (LIGE deals out the cards.)

CLARK'S VOICE: (Inside the store) You, Mattie! (MRS. CLARK, who has
been standing in the DOE, quickly turns and goes inside.)

LIGE: Y-e-e-e! Spades! (The game is started.)

LUM: Didn't snatch that jack, did you?

LIGE: Aw, no, ain't snatched no jack. Play.

WALTER: (LUM'S partner) Well, here it is, partner. What you want me to
play for you?

LUM: Play jus' like I'm in New York, partner. But we gotta try to
catch that jack.

LIGE: (Threateningly) Stick out your hand and draw back a nub.

(WALTER THOMAS plays.)

WALTER: I'm playin' a diamond for you, partner.

LUM: I done tole you you ain't got no partner.

LIGE: Heh, Heh! Partner, we got 'em. Pull off wid your king. Dey got
to play 'em. (When that trick is turned, triumphantly:) Didn't I tell
you, partner? (Stands on his feet and slams down with his ace
violently) Now, come up under this ace. Aw, hah, look at ol' low,
partner. I knew I was gonna catch 'em. (When LUM plays) Ho, ho, there
goes the queen.... Now, the jack's a gentleman.... Now, I'm playin' my
knots. (Everybody plays and the hand is ended.) Partner, high, low,
jack and the game and four.

WALTER: Give me them cards. I believe you-all done give me the cub
that time. Look at me ... this is Booker T Washington dealing these
cards. (Shuffles cards grandly and gives them to LIGE to cut.) Wanta
cut 'em?

LIGE: Yeah, cut 'em and shoot 'em. I'd cut behind my ma. (He cuts the
cards.)

WALTER: (Turning to player at left, FRANK, LIGE'S partner) What you
saying, Frank?

FRANK: I'm beggin'. (LIGE is trying to peep at cards.)

WALTER: (Turning to LIGE) Stop peepin' at them cards, Lige. (To FRANK)
Did you say you was beggin' or standin'?

FRANK: I'm beggin'.

WALTER: Get up off your knees. Go ahead and tell 'em I sent you.

FRANK: Well, that makes us four.

WALTER: I don't care if you is. (Pulls a quarter out of his pocket and
lays it down on the box.) Twenty-five cents says I know the best one.
Let's go. (Everybody puts down a quarter.)

FRANK: What you want me to play for you partner?

LIGE: Play me a club. (The play goes around to dealer, WALTER, who
gets up and takes the card off the top of the deck and slams it down
on the table.)

WALTER: Get up ol' deuce of deamonds and gallop off with your load.
(TO LUM) Partner, how many times you seen the deck?

LUM: Two times.

WALTER: Well, then I'm gonna pull off, partner. Watch this ol' queen.
(Everyone plays) Ha! Ha! Wash day and no soap. (Takes the jack of
diamonds and sticks him up on his forehead. Stands up on his feet.)
Partner, I'm dumping to you ... play your king. (When it comes to his
play LUM, too, stands up. The others get up and they, too, excitedly
slam their cards down.) Now, come on in this kitchen and let me splice
that cabbage! (He slams down the ace of diamonds. Pats the jack on his
for head, sings:) Hey, hey, back up, jenny, get your load. (Talking)
Dump to that jack, boys, dump to it. High, low, jack and the game and
four. One to go. We're four wid you, boys.

LIGE: Yeah, but you-all playin' catch-up.

FRANK: Gimme them cards ... lemme deal some.

LIGE: Frank, now you really got responsibility on you. They's got one
game on us.

FRANK: Aw, man, I'm gonna deal 'em up a mess. This deal's in the White
House. (He shuffles and puts the cards down for WALTER to cut.) Cut
'em.

WALTER: Nope, I never cut green timber. (FRANK deals and turns the
card up.)

FRANK: Hearts, boys. (He turns up an ace.)

LUM: Aw, you snatched that ace, nigger.

WALTER: Yeah, they done carried the cub to us, partner.

LIGE: Oh, he didn't do no such a thing. That ace was turned fair. We
jus' too hard for you ... we eats our dinner out a the blacksmith
shop.

WALTER: Aw, you all cheatin'. You know it wasn't fair.

FRANK: Aw, shut up, you all jus' whoopin' and hollerin' for nothin'.
Tryin' to bully the game. (FRANK and LIGE rise and shake hands
grandly.)

LIGE: Mr. Hoover, you sho is a noble president. We done stuck these
niggers full of cobs. They done got scared to play us.

LIGE (?) Scared to play you? Get back down to this table, let me
spread my mess.

LOUNGER: Yonder comes Elder Simms. You all better squat that rabbit.
They'll be having you all up in the church for playin' cards.

(FRANK grabs up the cards and puts them in his pocket quickly.
Everybody picks up the money and looks unconcerned as the preacher
enters. Enter ELDER SIMMS with his two prim-looking little children by
the hand.)

ELDER SIMMS: How do, children. Right warm for this time in November,
ain't it?

VOICE: Yes sir, Reverend, sho is. How's Sister Simms?

SIMMS: She's feelin' kinda po'ly today. (Goes on in store with his
children)

VOICE: (Whispering loudly) Don't see how that great big ole powerful
woman could be sick. Look like she could go bear huntin' with her
fist.

ANOTHER VOICE: She look jus' as good as you-all's Baptist pastor's
wife. Pshaw, you ain't seen no big woman, nohow, man. I seen one once
so big she went to whip her little boy and he run up under her belly
and hid six months 'fore she could find him.

ANOTHER VOICE: Well, I knowed a woman so little that she had to get up
on a soap box to look over a grain of sand.

(REV. SIMMS comes out of store, each child behind him sucking a stick
of candy.)

SIMMS: (To his children) Run on home to your mother and don't get
dirty on the way. (The two children start primly off down the street
but just out of sight one of them utters a loud cry.)

SIMMS'S CHILD: (Off stage) Papa, papa. Nunkie's trying to lick my
candy.

SIMMS: I told you to go on and leave them other children alone.

VOICE ON PORCH: (Kidding) Lum, whyn't you tend to your business.

(TOWN MARSHALL rises and shoos the children off again.)

LUM: You all varmints leave them nice chillun alone.

LIGE: (Continuing the lying on porch) Well, you all done seen so much,
but I bet you ain't never seen a snake as big as the one I saw when I
was a boy up in middle Georgia. He was so big couldn't hardly move his
self. He laid in one spot so long he growed moss on him and everybody
thought he was a log, till one day I set down on him and went to
sleep, and when I woke up that snake done crawled to Florida. (Loud
laughter.)

FRANK: (Seriously) Layin' all jokes aside though now, you all remember
that rattlesnake I killed last year was almost as big as that Georgia
snake.

VOICE: How big, you say it was, Frank?

FRANK: Maybe not quite as big as that, but jus' about fourteen feet.

VOICE: (Derisively) Gimme that lyin' snake. That snake wasn't but four
foot long when you killed him last year and you done growed him ten
feet in a year.

ANOTHER VOICE: Well, I don't know about that. Some of the snakes
around here is powerful long. I went out in my front yard yesterday
right after the rain and killed a great big ol' cottonmouth.

SIMMS: This sho is a snake town. I certainly can't raise no chickens
for 'em. They kill my little biddies jus' as fast as they hatch out.
And yes ... if I hadn't cut them weeds out of the street in front of
my parsonage, me or some of my folks woulda been snake-bit right at
our front door. (To whole crowd) Whyn't you all cut down these weeds
and clean up these streets?

HAMBO: Well, the Mayor ain't said nothin' 'bout it.

SIMMS: When the folks misbehaves in this town I think they oughta lock
'em up in a jail and make 'em work their fine out on the streets, then
these weeds would be cut down.

VOICE: How we gonna do that when we ain't got no jail?

SIMMS: Well, you sho needs a jail ... you-all needs a whole lot of
improvements round this town. I ain't never pastored no town so
way-back as this one here.

CLARK: (Who has lately emerged from the store, fanning himself,
overhears this last remark and bristles up) What's that you say 'bout
this town?

SIMMS: I say we needs some improvements here in this town ... that's
what.

CLARK: (In a powerful voice) And what improvements you figgers we
needs?

SIMMS: A whole heap. Now, for one thing we really does need a jail,
Mayor. We oughta stop runnin' these people out of town that
misbehaves, and lock 'em up. Others towns has jails, everytown I ever
pastored had a jail. Don't see how come we can't have one.

CLARK: (Towering angrily above the preacher) Now, wait a minute,
Simms. Don't you reckon the man who knows how to start a town knows
how to run it? I paid two hundred dollars out of this right hand for
this land and walked out here and started this town befo' you was
born. I ain't like some of you new niggers, come here when grapes'
ripe. I was here to cut new ground, and I been Mayor ever since.

SIMMS: Well, there ain't no sense in no one man stayin' Mayor all the
time.

CLARK: Well, it's my town and I can be mayor jus' as long as I want
to. It was me that put this town on the map.

SIMMS: What map you put it on, Joe Clark? I ain't seen it on no map.

CLARK: (Indignant) I God! Listen here, Elder Simms. If you don't like
the way I run this town, just' take your flat feets right on out and
git yonder crost the woods. You ain't been here long enough to say
nothin' nohow.

HAMBO: (From a nail keg) Yeah, you Methodist niggers always telling
people how to run things.

TAYLOR: (Practically unheard by the others) We do so know how to run
things, don't we? Ain't Brother Mayor a Methodist, and ain't the
school-teacher a ...? (His remarks are drowned out by the others.)

SIMMS: No, we don't like the way you're runnin' things. Now looka
here, (Pointing at the Marshall) You got that lazy Lum Boger here for
marshall and he ain't old enough to be dry behind his ears yet ... and
all these able-bodied means in this town! You won't 'low nobody else
to run a store 'ceptin' you. And looka yonder (happening to notice the
street light) only street lamp in town, you got in front of your
place. (Indignantly) We pay the taxes and you got the lamp.

VILLAGER: Don't you-all fuss now. How come you two always yam-yamming
at each other?

CLARK: How come this fly-by-night Methodist preacher over here ...
ain't been here three months ... tries to stand up on my store porch
and tries to tell me how to run my town? (MATTIE CLARK, the Mayor's
wife, comes timidly to the door, wiping her hands on her apron.) Ain't
no man gonna tell me how to run my town. I God, I 'lected myself in
and I'm gonna run it. (Turns and sees wife standing in door.
Commandingly.) I God, Mattie, git on back in there and wait on that
store!

MATTIE: (Timidly) Jody, somebody else wantin' stamps.

CLARK: I God, woman, what good is you? Gwan, git in. Look like between
women and preachers a man can't have no peace. (Exit CLARK.)

SIMMS: (Continuing his argument) Now, when I pastored in Jacksonville
you oughta see what kinda jails they got there....

LOUNGER: White folks needs jails. We colored folks don't need no jail.

ANOTHER VILLAGER: Yes, we do, too. Elder Simms is right....

(The argument becomes a hubbub of voices.)

TAYLOR: (Putting down his basket) Now, I tell you a jail....

MRS. TAYLOR: (Emerging from the store door, arms full of groceries,
looking at her husband) Yeah, and if you don't shut up and git these
rations home I'm gonna be worse on you than a jail and six judges.
Pickup that basket and let's go. (TONY meekly picks up the basket and
he and his wife exit as the sound of an approaching guitar is heard
off stage.)

(Two carelessly dressed, happy-go-lucky fellows enter together. One is
fingering a guitar without playing any particular tune, and the other
has his hat cocked over his eyes in a burlesque, dude-like manner.
There are casual greetings.)

WALTER: Hey, there, bums, how's tricks?

LIGE: What yo' sayin', boys?

HAMBO: Good evenin' sons.

LIGE: How did you-all make out this evenin', boys?

JIM: Oh, them white folks at the party shelled out right well. Kept
Dave busy pickin' it up. How much did we make today, Dave?

DAVE: (Striking his pocket) I don't know, boy, but feels right heavy
here. Kept me pickin' up money just like this.... (As JIM picks a few
dance chords, Dave gives a dance imitation of how he picked up the
coins from the ground as the white folks threw them.) We count it
after while. Woulda divided up with you already if you hadn't left me
when you seen Daisy comin' by. Let's sit down on the porch and rest
now.

LIGE: She sho is lookin' stylish and pretty since she come back with
her white folks from up North. Wearin' the swellest clothes. And that
coal-black hair of hers jus' won't quit.

MATTIE CLARK: (In doorway) I don't see what the mens always hanging
after Daisy Taylor for.

CLARK: (Turning around on the porch) I God, you back here again. Who's
tendin' that store? (MATTIE disappears inside.)

DAVE: Well, she always did look like new money to me when she was here
before.

JIM: Well, that's all you ever did get was a look.

DAVE: That's all you know! I bet I get more than that now.

JIM: You might git it but I'm the man to use it. I'm a bottom fish.

DAVE: Aw, man. You musta been walking round here fast asleep when
Daisy was in this county last. You ain't seen de go I had with her.

JIM: No, I ain't seen it. Bet you didn't have no letter from her while
she been away.

DAVE: Bet you didn't neither.

JIM: Well, it's just cause she can't write. If she knew how to scratch
with a pencil I'd had a ton of 'em.

DAVE: Shaw, man! I'd had a post office full of 'em.

OLD WOMAN: You-all ought to be shame, carrying on over a brazen heifer
like Daisy Taylor. Jus' cause she's been up North and come back, I
reckon you cutting de fool sho 'nough now. She ain't studying none of
you-all nohow. All she wants is what you got in your pocket.

JIM: I likes her but she won't git nothin' outa me. She never did. I
wouldn't give a poor consumpted cripple crab a crutch to cross the
River Jurdon.

DAVE: I know I ain't gonna give no woman nothin'. I wouldn't give a
dog a doughnut if he treed a terrapin.

LIGE: Youse a cottontail dispute ... both of you. You'd give her
anything you got. You'd give her Georgia with a fence 'round it.

OLD MAN: Yeah, and she'd take it, too.

LINDSAY: Don't distriminate the woman like that. That ain't nothing
but hogism. Ain't nothin' the matter with Daisy, she's all right.

(Enter TEETS and BOOTSIE tittering coyly and switching themselves.)

BOOTSIE: Is you seen my mama?

OLD WOMAN: You know you ain't lookin' for no mama. Jus' come back down
here to show your shape and fan around awhile. (BOOTSIE and TEETS
going into the store.)

BOOTSIE & TEETS: No, we ain't. We'se come to get our mail.

OLD WOMAN: (After girls enter store) Why don't you all keep up some
attention to these nice girls here, Bootsie and Teets. They wants to
marry.

DAVE: Aw, who thinkin' 'bout marryin' now? They better stay home and
eat their own pa's rations. I gotta buy myself some shoes.

JIM: The woman I'm gonna marry ain't born yet and her maw is dead.

(GIRLS come out giggling and exit.) (JIM begins to strum his guitar
lightly at first as the talk goes on.)

CLARK: (To DAVE and JIM) Two of the finest gals that ever lived and
friendly jus' like you-all is. You two boys better take 'em back and
stop them shiftless ways.

HAMBO: Yeah, hurry up and do somethin'! I wants to taste a piece yo'
weddin' cake.

JIM: (Embarrassed but trying to be jocular) Whut you trying to rush
me up so fast?... Look at Will Cody here (Pointing to little man on
porch) he been promising to bring his already wife down for two
months ... and nair one of us ain't seen her yet.

DAVE: Yeah, how you speck me to haul in a brand new wife when he can't
lead a wagon-broke wife eighteen miles? Me, I'm going git one soon's
Cody show me his'n. (General sly laughter at CODY'S expense.)

WALTER: (Snaps his fingers and pretends to remember something) Thass
right, Cody. I been intending to tell you.... I know where you kin buy
a ready-built house for you and yo' wife. (Calls into the store.) Hey,
Clark, cime on out here and tell Cody 'bout dat Bradley house. (To
CODY.) I know you wants to git a place of yo' own so you kin settle
down.

HAMBO: He done moved so much since he been here till every time he
walk out in his back yeard his chickens lay down and cross they legs.

LINDSAY: Cody, I thought you tole us you was going up to Sanford to
bring dat 'oman down here last Sat'day.

LIGE: That ain't de way he tole me 'bout it. Look, fellers, (Getting
up and putting one hand on his hips and one finger of the other hand
against his chin coquettishly) Where you reckon I'll be next Sat'day
night?... Sittin' up side of Miz Cody. (Great burst of laughter.)

SYKES JONES: (Laughing) Know what de folks tole me in Sanford? Dat was
another man's wife. (Guffaws.)

CODY: (Feebly) Aw, you don't know whut you talkin' bout.

JONES: Naw, I don't know, but de folks in Sanford does. (Laughing) Dey
tell me when dat lady's husband come home Sat'day night, ole Cody
jumped out de window. De man grabbed his old repeater and run out in
de yard to head him off. When Cody seen him come round de corner de
house (Gesture) he flopped his wings and flew up on de fence. De man
thowed dat shotgun dead on him. (Laughs) Den, man! Cody flopped his
wings lak a buzzard (Gesture) and sailed on off. De man dropped to his
knees lak dis (Gesture of kneeling on one knee and taking aim) Die!
die! die! (Supposedly sound of shots as the gun is moved in a circle
following the course of Cody's supposed flight) Cody just flew right
on off and lit on a hill two miles off. Then, man! (Gesture of swift
flight) In ten minutes he was back here in Eatonville and in he bed.

WALTER: I passed there and seen his house shakin', but I didn't know
how come.

HAMBO: Aw, leave de boy alone.... If you don't look out some of y'all
going to have to break his record.

LIGE: I'm prepared to break it now. (General laughter.)

JIM: Well, anyhow, I don't want to marry and leave Dave ... yet
awhile. (Picking a chord.)

DAVE: And I ain't gonna leave Jim. We been palling around together
ever since we hollered titty mama, ain't we, boy?

JIM: Sho is. (Music of the guitar increases in volume. DAVE shuffles a
few steps and the two begin to sing.)

JIM:
  Rabbit on the log.
  I ain't got no dog.
  How am I gonna git him?
  God knows.

DAVE:
  Rabbit on the log.
  Ain't got no dog.
  Shoot him with my rifle
  Bam! Bam!

(Some of the villagers join in song and others get up and march around
the porch in time with the music. BOOTSIE and TEETS re-enter, TEETS
sticking her letter down the neck of her blouse. JOE LINDSAY grabs
TEETS and WALTER THOMAS grabs BOOTSIE. There is dancing, treating and
general jollification. Little children dance the parse-me-la. The
music fills the air just as the sun begins to go down. Enter DAISY
TAYLOR coming down the road toward the store.)

CLARK: (Bawls out from the store porch) I God, there's Daisy again.

(Most of the dancing stops, the music slows down and then stops
completely. DAVE and JIM greet DAISY casually as she approaches the
porch.)

JIM: Well, Daisy, we knows you, too.

DAVE: Gal, youse jus' as pretty as a speckled pup.

DAISY: (Giggling) I see you two boys always playin' and singin'
together. That music sounded right good floating down the road.

JIM: Yeah, child, we'se been playin' for the white folks all week.
We'se playin' for the colored now.

DAVE: (Showing off, twirling his dancing feet) Yeah, we're standin' on
our abstract and livin' on our income.

OLD MAN: Um-ump, but they ain't never workin'. Just round here playing
as usual.

JIM: Some folks think you ain't workin' lessen you smellin' a mule.
(He sits back down on box and picks at his guitar.) Think you gotta
be beatin' a man to his barn every mornin'.

VOICE: Glad to be round home with we-all again, ain't you Daisy?

DAISY: Is I glad? I jus' got off special early this evenin' to come
over here and see everybody. I was kinda 'fraid sundown would catch me
'fore I got round that lake. Don't know how I'm gonna walk back to my
workin' place in the dark by muself.

DAVE: Don't no girl as good-lookin' as you is have to go home by
herself tonight.

JIM: No, cause I'm here.

DAVE: (To DAISY) Don't you trust yourself round that like wid all them
'gators and moccasins with that nigger there, Daisy (Pointing at JIM)
He's jus' full of rabbit blood. What you need is a real man ... with
good feet. (Cutting a dance step.)

DAISY: I ain't thinking 'bout goin' home yet. I'm goin' in the store.

JIM: What you want in the store?

DAISY: I want some gum.

DAVE: (Starting toward door) Girl, you don't have to go in there to
git no gum. I'll go in there and buy you a carload of gum. What kind
you want?

DAISY: Bubble gum. (DAVE goes in the store with his hand in his
pocket. The sun is setting and the twilight deepens.)

JIM: (Pulling package out of his pocket and laughing) Here your gum,
baby. What it takes to please the ladies, I totes it. I don't have to
go get it, like Dave. What you gimme for it?

DAISY: A bushel and a peck, and a hug around the neck. (She embraces
JIM playfully. He hands her the gum, patting his shoulder as he sits
on box.) Oh, thank you. Youse a ready man.

JIM: Yeah, there's a lot of good parts to me. You can have West Tampa
if you want it.

DAISY: You always was a nice quiet boy, Jim.

DAVE: (Emerging from the store with a package of gum) Here's your gum,
Daisy.

JIM: Oh, youse late. She's done got gum now. Chaw that yourself.

DAVE: (Slightly peeved and surprised) Hunh, you mighty fast here now
with Daisy but you wasn't that fast gettin' out of that white man's
chicken house last week.

JIM: Who you talkin' 'bout?

DAVE: Hoo-oo? (Facetiously) You ain't no owl. Your feet don't fit no
limb.

JIM: Aw, nigger, hush.

DAVE: Aw, hush, yourself. (He walks away for a minute as DAISY turns
to meet some newcomers. DAVE throws his package of gum down on the
ground. It breaks and several children scramble for the pieces. An old
man, very drunk, carrying an empty jug enters on left and staggers
tipsily across stage.) (MAYOR JOE CLARK emerges from the store and
looks about for his marshall.)

CLARK: (Bellowing) Lum Boger!

LUM BOGER: (Eating a stalk of cane) Yessir!

CLARK: I God, Lum, take your lazy self off that keg and go light that
town lamp. All summer long you eatin' up my melon, and all winter long
you chawin' up my cane. What you think this town is payin' you for?
Laying round here doin' nothin'? Can't you see it's gettin' dark?

(LUM BOGER rises lazily and takes the soap box down stage, stands on
it to light the lamp, discovers no oil in it and goes in store. In a
few moments he comes out of store, fills the lamp and lights it.)

DAISY: (Coming back toward JIM) Ain't you all gonna play and sing a
little somethin' for me? I ain't heard your all's music much for so
long.

JIM: Play anything you want, Daisy. Don't make no difference what 'tis
I can pick it. Where's that old coon, Dave? (Looking around for his
partner.)

LIGE: (Calling Dave, who is leaning against post at opposite end of
porch) Come here, an' get warmed up for Daisy.

DAVE: Aw, ma throat's tired.

JIM: Leave the baby be.

DAISY: Come on, sing a little, Dave.

DAVE: (Going back toward Jim) Well, seeing who's asking ... all right.
What song yo like, Daisy?

DAISY: Um-m. Lemme think.

VOICE ON PORCH: "Got on the train, didn't have no fare".

DAISY: (Gaily) Yes, that one. That's a good one.

JIM: (Begins to tune up. DAVE touches Daisy's hand.)

VOICE: (In fun) Hunh, you all wouldn't play at the hall last week when
we asked you.

VOICE OF SPITEFUL OLD WOMAN: Daisy wasn't here then.

ANOTHER VOICE: (Teasingly) All you got to do to some men is to shake a
skirt tail in their face and they goes off their head.

DAVE: (To JIM who is still tuning up) Come if you're comin' boy, let's
go if you gwine. (The full melody of the guitar comes out in a lively,
old-fashioned tune.)

VOICE: All right now, boys, do it for Daisy jus' as good as you do for
dem white folks over in Maitland.

DAVE & JIM: (Beginning to sing)
  Got on the train,
  Didn't have no fare,
  But I rode some,
  I rode some.
  Got on the train,
  Didn't have no fare,
  But I rode some,
  But I rode some.
  Got on the train,
  Didn't have no fare,
  Conductor asked me what I'm doin' there,
  But I rode some!

  Grabbed me by the neck
  And led me to the door.
  But I rode some,
  But I rode some.
  Grabbed me by the neck
  And led me to the door.
  But I rode some,
  But I rode some.
  Grabbed me by the neck,
  And led me to the door.
  Rapped me cross the head with a forty-four,
  But I rode some.

  First thing I saw in jail
  Was a pot of peas.
  But I rode some,
  But I rode some.
  First thing I saw in jail
  Was a pot of peas.
  But I rode some,
  But I rode some.
  The peas was good,
  The meat was fat,
  Fell in love with the chain gang jus' for that,
  But I rode some.

(DAVE acts out the song in dancing pantomime and when it ends there
are shouts and general exclamations of approval from the crowd.)

VOICES: I don't blame them white folks for goin' crazy 'bout that....

OLD MAN: Oh, when I was a young boy I used to swing the gals round on
that piece.

DAISY: (TO JIM) Seem like your playin' gits better and better.

DAVE: (Quickly) And how 'bout my singin'? (Everybody laughs.)

VOICES IN THE CROWD: Ha! Ha! Ol' Dave's gittin' jealous when she
speaks o' Jim.

JIM: (To DAVE, in fun) Ain't nothin' to it but my playin'. You ain't
got no singin' voice. If that's singin', God's a gopher.

DAVE: (Half-seriously) My singin' is a whole lot better'n your
playin'. You jus' go along and fram. The reason why the white folks
gives us money is cause I'm singin'.

JIM: Yeah?

DAVE: And you can't dance.

VOICE IN THE CROWD: You oughta dance. Big as your feet is, Dave.

DAISY: (Diplomatically) Both of you all is wonderful and I would like
to see Dave dance a little.

DAVE: There now, I told you. What did I tell you. (To JIM) Stop
woofing and pick a little tune there so that I can show Daisy
somethin'.

JIM: Pick a tune? I bet if you fool with me I'll pick your bones jus'
like a buzzard did the rabbit. You can't sing and now you wants to
dance.

DAVE: Yeah, and I'll lam your head. Come on and play,
good-for-nothing.

JIM: All right, then. You say you can dance ... show these people what
you can do. But don't bring that little stuff I been seein' you doin'
all these years. (JIM plays and DAVE dances, various members of the
crowd keep time with their hands and feet, DAISY looks on enjoying
herself immensely.)

DAISY: (As DAVE cuts a very fancy step) I ain't seen nothin' like this
up North. Dave you sho hot.

(As DAVE cuts a more complicated step the crowd applauds, but just as
the show begins to get good, suddenly JIM stops playing.)

DAVE: (Surprised) What's the matter, buddy?

JIM: (Envious of the attention DAVE has been getting from DAISY,
disgustedly) Oh, nigger, I'm tired of seein' you cut the fool. 'Sides
that, I been playin' all afternoon for the white folks.

DAISY: But I though you was playin' for me now, Jim.

JIM: Yeah, I'd play all night long for you, but I'm gettin' sick of
Dave round here showin' off. Let him git somethin' and play for
himself if he can. (An OLD MAN with a lighted lantern enters.)

DAISY: (Coyly) Well, honey, play some more for me, then, and don't
mind Dave. I reckon he done danced enough. Play me "Shake That
Thing".

OLD MAN WITH LANTERN: Sho, you ain't stopped, is you, boy? Music sound
mighty good floatin' down that dark road.

OLD WOMAN: Yeah, Jim, go on play a little more. Don't get to acting so
niggerish this evening.

DAVE: Aw, let the ol' darky alone. Nobody don't want to hear him play,
nohow. I know I don't.

JIM: Well, I'm gonna play. (And he begins to pick "Shake That Thing".
TEETS and BOOTSIE begin to dance with LIGE MOSELY and FRANK WARRICK.
As the tune gets good, DAVE cannot resist the music either.)

DAVE: Old nigger's eveil but he sho can play. (He begins to do a few
steps by himself, then twirls around in front of DAISY and approaches
her. DAISY, overcome by the music, begins to step rhythmically toward
DAVE and together they dance unobserved by JIM, absorbed in picking
his guitar.)

DAISY: Look here, baby, at this new step I learned up North.

DAVE: You can show me anything, sugar lump.

DAISY: Hold me tight now. (But just as they begin the new movement JIM
notices DAISY and DAVE. He stops playing again and lays his guitar
down.)

VOICES IN THE CROWD: (Disgustedly) Aw, come on, Jim.... You must be
jealous....

JIM: No, I ain't jealous. I jus' get tired of seein' that ol' nigger
clownin' all the time.

DAVE: (Laughing and pointing to JIM on porch) Look at that mad baby.
Take that lip up off the ground. Got your mouth stuck out jus' because
some one is enjoying themselves. (He comes up and pushes JIM
playfully.)

JIM: You better go head and let me alone. (TO DAISY) Come here,
Daisy!

LIGE: That's just what I say. Niggers can't have no fun without
someone getting mad ... specially over a woman.

JIM: I ain't mad.... Daisy, 'scuse me, honey, but that fool, Dave....

DAVE: I ain't mad neither.... Jim always tryin' to throw off on me.
But you can't joke him.

DAISY: (Soothingly) Aw, now, now!

JIM: You ain't jokin'. You means that, nigger. And if you tryin' to
get hot, first thing, you can pull of my blue shirt you put on this
morning.

DAVE: Youse a got that wrong. I ain't got on no shirt of yours.

JIM: Yes, you is got on my shirt, too. Don't tell me you ain't got on
my shirt.

DAVE: Well, even if I is, you can just lift your big plantations out
of my shoes. You can just foot it home barefooted.

JIM: You try to take any shoes offa me!

LIGE: (Pacifying them) Aw, there ain't no use of all that. What you
all want to start this quarreling for over a little jokin'.

JIM: Nobody's quarreling.... I'm just playin' a little for Daisy and
Dave's out there clownin' with her.

CLARK: (In doorway) I ain't gonna have no fussin' round my store, no
way. Shut up, you all.

JIM: Well, Mayor Clark, I ain't mad with him. We'se been friends all
our lives. He's slept in my bed and wore my clothes and et my grub....

DAVE: I et your grub? And many time as you done laid down with your
belly full of my grandma's collard greens. You done et my meat and
bread a whole lot more times than I et your stewed fish-heads.

JIM: I'd rather eat stewed fish-heads than steal out of other folkses
houses so much till you went to sleep on the roost and fell down one
night and broke up the settin' hen. (Loud laughter from the crowd)

DAVE: Youse a liar if you say I stole anybody's chickens. I didn't
have to. But you ... 'fore you started goin' around with me, playin'
that little box of yours, you was so hungry you had the white mouth.
If it wasn't for these white folks throwin' _me_ money for _my_
dancin', you would be thin as a whisper right now.

JIM: (Laughing sarcastically) Your dancin'! You been leapin' around
here like a tailless monkey in a wash pot for a long time and nobody
was payin' no 'tention to you, till I come along playing.

LINDSAY: Boys, boys, that ain't no way for friends to carry on.

DAISY: Well, if you all gonna keep up this quarrelin' and carryin' on
I'm goin' home. 'Bout time for me to be gittin' back to my white folks
anyhow. It's dark now. I'm goin', even if I have to go by myself. I
shouldn't a stopped by here nohow.

JIM: (Stopping his quarrel) You ain't gonna go home by yourself. I'm
goin' with you.

DAVE: (Singing softly)
  It may be so,
  I don't know.
  But it sounds to me
  Like a lie.

WALTER: Dave ain't' got as much rabbit blood as folks thought.

DAVE: Tell 'em 'bout me. (Turns to DAISY) Won't you choose a treat on
me, Miss Daisy, 'fore we go?

DAISY: (Coyly) Yessir, thank you. I wants a drink of soda water.

(DAVE pulls his hat down over his eyes, whirls around and offers his
arm to DAISY. They strut into the store, DAVE gazing contemptuously at
JIM as he passes. Crowd roars with laughter, much to the embarrassment
of JIM.)

LIGE: Ol' fast Dave jus' runnin' the hog right over you, Jim.

WALTER: Thought you was such a hot man.

LUM BOGER: Want me to go in there and put Daisy under arrest and bring
her to you?

JIM: (Sitting down on the edge of porch with one foot on the step and
lights a cigarette pretending not to be bothered.) Aw, I'll get her
when I want her. Let him treat her, but see who struts around that
lake and down the railroad with her by and by.

(DAVE and DAISY emerge from the store, each holding a bottle of red
soda pop and laughing together. As they start down the steps DAVE
accidentally steps on JIM's outstretched foot. JIM jumps up and pushes
DAVE back, causing him to spill the red soda all over his white shirt
front.)

JIM: Stay off my foot, you big ox.

DAVE: Well, you don't have to wet me all up, do you, and me in
company? Why don't you put your damn foot in your pocket?

DAISY: (Wiping DAVE'S shirt front with her handkerchief) Aw, ain't
that too bad.

JIM: (To DAVE) Well, who's shirt did I wet? It's mine, anyhow, ain't
it?

DAVE: (Belligerently) Well, if it's your shirt, then you come take it
off me. I'm tired of your lip.

JIM: Well, I will.

DAVE: Well, put your fist where you lip is. (Pushing DAISY aside.)

DAISY: (Frightened) I want to go home. Now, don't you all boys fight.

(JIM attempts to come up the steps. DAVE pushes him back and he
stumbles and falls in the dust. General excitement as the crowd senses
a fight.)

LITTLE BOY: (On the edge of crowd) Fight, fight, you're no kin. Kill
one another, won't be no sin. Fight, fight, you're no kin.

(JIM jumps up and rushes for DAVE as the latter starts down the steps.
DAVE meets him with his fist squarely in the face and causes him to
step backward, confused.)

DAISY: (Still on porch, half crying) Aw, my Lawd! I want to go home.

(General hubbub, women's cries of "Don't let 'em fight." "Why don't
somebody stop 'em?" "What kind of men is you all, sit there and let
them boys fight like that." Men's voices urging the fight: "Aw, let
'em fight." "Go for him, Dave." "Slug him, Jim."

JIM makes another rush toward the steps. He staggers DAVE. DAVE knocks
JIM sprawling once more. This time JIM grabs the mule bone as he
rises, rushes DAVE, strikes DAVE over the head with it and knocks him
out. DAVE falls prone on his back. There is great excitement.)

OLD WOMAN: (Screams) Lawdy, is he kilt? (Several men rush to the
fallen man.)

VOICE: Run down to the pump and get a dipper o' water.

CLARK: (To his wife in door) Mattie, come out of that store with a
bottle of witch hazely oil quick as you can. Jim Weston, I'm gonna
arrest you for this. You Lum Boger. Where is that marshall? Lum Boger!
(LUM BOGER detaches himself from the crowd.) Arrest Jim.

LUM: (Grabs JIM'S arm, relieves him of the mule bone and looks
helplessly at the Mayor.) Now I got him arrested, what's I going to do
with him?

CLARK: Lock him up back yonder in my barn till Monday when we'll have
the trial in de Baptist Church.

LINDSAY: Yeah, just like all the rest of them Methodists ... always
tryin' to take undercurrents on people.

WALTER: Ain't no worse then some of you Baptists, nohow. You all don't
run this town. We got jus' as much to say as you have.

CLARK: (Angrily to both men) Shut up! Done had enough arguing in front
of my place. (To LUM BOGER) Take that boy on and lock him up in my
barn. And save that mule bone for evidence.

(LUM BOGER leads JIM off toward the back of the store. A crowd follows
him. Other men and women are busy applying restoratives to DAVE. DAISY
stands alone, unnoticed in the center of the stage.)

DAISY: (Worriedly) Now, who's gonna take me home?

ACT TWO


SCENE I

SETTING: Village street scene; huge oak tree upstage center; a house
or two on back drop. When curtain goes up, Sister LUCY TAYLOR is seen
standing under the tree. She is painfully spelling it out.

(Enter SISTER THOMAS, a younger woman (In her thirties) at left.)

SISTER THOMAS: Evenin', Sis Taylor.

SISTER TAYLOR: Evenin'. (Returns to the notice)

SISTER THOMAS: Whut you doin'? Readin' dat notice Joe Clark put up
'bout de meeting? (Approaches tree)

SISTER TAYLOR: Is dat whut it says? I ain't much on readin' since I
had my teeth pulled out. You know if you pull out dem eye teeth you
ruins' yo' eye sight. (Turns back to notice) Whut it say?

SISTER THOMAS: (Reading notice) "The trial of Jim Weston for assault
and battery on Dave Carter wid a dangerous weapon will be held at
Macedonia Baptist Church on Monday, November 10, at three o'clock. All
are welcome. By order of J. Clark, Mayor of Eatonville, Florida."
(Turning to SISTER TAYLOR) Hit's makin' on to three now.

SISTER TAYLOR: You mean it's right _now_. (Looks up at sun to tell
time) Lemme go git ready to be at de trial 'cause I'm sho goin' to be
there an' I ain't goin' to bite my tongue neither.

SISTER THOMAS: I done went an' crapped a mess of collard greens for
supper. I better go put 'em on 'cause Lawd knows when we goin' to git
outa there an' my husband is one of them dat's gointer eat don't keer
whut happen. I bet if judgment day was to happen tomorrow he'd speck I
orter fix him a bucket to carry long. (She moves to exit, right)

SISTER TAYLOR: All men favors they guts, chile. But what you think of
all dis mess they got goin' on round here?

SISTER THOMAS: I just think it's a sin an' a shame befo' de livin'
justice de way dese Baptis' niggers is runnin' round here carryin' on.

SISTER TAYLOR: Oh, they been puttin' out the brags ever since Sat'day
night 'bout whut they gointer do to Jim. They thinks they runs this
town. They tell me Rev. CHILDERS preached a sermon on it yistiddy.

SISTER THOMAS: Lawd help us! He can't preach an' he look like 10 cents
worth of have-mercy let lone gittin' up dere tryin' to throw slams at
us. Now all Elder Simms done wuz to explain to us our rights ... whut
you think 'bout Joe Clarke runnin' round here takin' up for these ole
Baptist niggers?

SISTER TAYLOR: De puzzle-gut rascal ... we oughter have him up in
conference an' put him out de Methdis' faith. He don't b'long in
there--wanter tun dat boy outa town for nothin'.

SISTER THOMAS: But we all know how come he so hot to law Jim outa
town--hit's to dig de foundation out from under Elder Simms.

SISTER TAYLOR: Whut he wants do dat for?

SISTER THOMAS: 'Cause he wants to be a God-know-it-all an' a
God-do-it-all an' Simms is de onliest one in this town whut will buck
up to him.

(Enter SISTER JONES, walking leisurely)

SISTER JONES: Hello, Hoyt, hello, Lucy.

SISTER TAYLOR: Goin' to de meetin'?

SISTER JONES: Done got my clothes on de line an' I'm bound to be dere.

SISTER THOMAS: Gointer testify for Jim?

SISTER JONES: Naw, I reckon--don't make such difference to me which
way de drop fall.... 'Tain't neither one of 'em much good.

SISTER TAYLOR: I know it. I know it, Ida. But dat ain't de point. De
crow we wants to pick is: Is we gointer set still an' let dese Baptist
tell us when to plant an' when to pluck up?

SISTER JONES: Dat is something to think about when you come to think
'bout it. (Starts to move on) Guess I better go ahead--see y'all later
an tell you straighter.

(Enter ELDER SIMMS, right, walking fast, Bible under his arm, almost
collides with SISTER JONES as she exits.)

SIMMS: Oh, 'scuse me, Sister Jones. (She nods and smiles and exits.)
How you do, Sister Taylor, Sister Thomas.

BOTH: Good evenin', Elder.

SIMMS: Sho is a hot day.

SISTER TAYLOR: Yeah, de bear is walkin' de earth lak a natural man.

SISTER THOMAS: Reverend, look like you headed de wrong way. It's
almost time for de trial an' youse all de dependence we got.

SIMMS: I know it. I'm tryin' to find de marshall so we kin go after
Jim. I wants a chance to talk wid him a minute before court sets.

SISTER TAYLOR: Y'think he'll come clear?

SIMMS: (Proudly) I _know_ it! (Shakes the Bible) I'm goin' to law 'em
from Genesis to Revelation.

SISTER THOMAS: Give it to 'em, Elder. Wear 'em out!

SIMMS: We'se liable to havea new Mayor when all dis dust settle. Well,
I better scuffle on down de road. (Exits, left.)

SISTER THOMAS: Lord, lemme gwan home an' put dese greens on. (Looks
off stage left) Here come Mayor Clark now, wid his belly settin' out
in front of him like a cow catcher! His name oughter be Mayor Belly.

SISTER TAYLOR: (Arms akimbo) Jus' look at him! Tryin' to look like a
jigadier Breneral.

(Enter CLARK hot and perspiring. They look at him coldly.)

CLARK: I God, de bear got me! (Silence for a moment) How y'all
feelin', ladies?

SISTER TAYLOR: Brother Mayor, I ain't one of these folks dat bite my
tongue an' bust my gall--whut's inside got to come out! I can't see to
my rest why you cloakin' in wid dese Baptist buzzards 'ginst yo' own
church.

MAYOR CLARK: I ain't cloakin' in wid _none_. I'm de Mayor of dis whole
town I stands for de right an' ginst de wrong--I don't keer who it
kill or cure.

SISTER THOMAS: You think it's right to be runnin' dat boy off for
nothin'?

CLARK: I God! You call knockin' a man in de head wid a mule bone
nothin'? 'Nother thin; I done missed nine of my best-layin' hens. I
ain't sayin' Jim got 'em, but different people has tole me he burries
a powerful lot of feathers in his back yard. I God, I'm a ruint man!
(He starts towards the right exit, but LUM BOGER enters right.) I God,
Lum, I been lookin' for you all day. It's almost three o'clock. (Hands
him a key from his ring) Take dis key an' go fetch Jim Weston on to de
church.

LUM: Have you got yo' gavel from de lodge-room?

CLARK: I God, that's right, Lum. I'll go get it from de lodge room
whilst you go git de bone an' de prisoner. Hurry up! You walk like
dead lice droppin' off you. (He exits right while LUM crosses stage
towards left.)

SISTER TAYLOR: Lum, Elder Simms been huntin' you--he's gone on down
'bout de barn. (She gestures)

LUM BOGER: I reckon I'll overtake him. (Exit left.)

SISTER THOMAS: I better go put dese greens on. My husband will kill me
if he don't find no supper ready. Here come Mrs. Blunt. She oughter
feel like a penny's worth of have-mercy wid all dis stink behind her
daughter.

SISTER TAYLOR: Chile, some folks don't keer. They don't raise they
chillun; they drags 'em up. God knows if dat Daisy wuz mine, I'd throw
her down an' put a hundred lashes on her back wid a plow-line. Here
she come in de store Sat'day night (Acts coy and coquettish,
burlesques DAISY'S walk) a wringing and a twisting!

(Enter MRS. BLUNT, left.)

MRS. BLUNT: How y'all sisters?

SISTER THOMAS: Very well, Miz Blunt, how you?

MRS. BLUNT: Oh, so-so.

MRS. TAYLOR: I'm kickin', but not high.

MRS. BLUNT: Well, thank God you still on prayin' ground an' in a Bible
country. Me, I ain't so many today. De niggers got my Daisy's name all
mixed up in dis mess.

MRS. TAYLOR: You musn't mind dat, Sister Blunt. People jus' _will_
talk. They's talkin' in New York an' they's talkin' in Georgy an'
they's talkin' in Italy.

SISTER THOMAS: Chile, if you talk folkses talk, they'll have you in de
graveyard or in Chattahoochee one. You can't pay no 'tention to talk.

MRS. BLUNT: Well, I know one thing. De man or women, chick or child,
grizzly or gray, that tells me to my face anything wrong 'bout _my_
chile, I'm goin' to take _my_ fist (Rolls up right sleeve and gestures
with right fist) and knock they teeth down they throat. (She looks
ferocious) 'Case y'all know I raised my Daisy right round my feet till
I let her go up north last year wid them white folks. I'd ruther her
to be in de white folks' kitchen than walkin' de streets like some of
dese girls round here. If I do say so, I done raised a lady. She can't
help it if all dese mens get stuck on her.

MRS. TAYLOR: You'se tellin' de truth, Sister Blunt. That's whut I
always say: Don't confidence dese niggers. Do, they'll sho put you in
de street.

MRS. THOMAS: Naw indeed, never syndicate wid niggers. Do, they will
distriminate you. They'll be an _anybody_. You goin' to de trial,
ain't you?

MRS. BLUNT: Just as sho as you snore. An' they better leave Daisy's
name outa dis, too. I done told her and told her to come straight home
from her work. Naw, she had to stop by dat store and skin her gums
back wid dem trashy niggers. She better not leave them white folks
today to come traipsin' over here scornin' her name all up wid dis
nigger mess. Do, I'll kill her. No daughter of mine ain't goin' to do
as she please, long as she live under de sound of my voice. (She
crosses to right.)

MRS. THOMAS: That's right, Sister Blunt. I glory in yo' spunk. Lord, I
better go put on my supper.

(As MRS. BLUNT exits, right, REV. CHILDERS enters left with DAVE and
DEACON LINDSAY and SISTER LEWIS. Very hostile glances from SISTERS
THOMAS and TAYLOR toward the others.)

CHILDERS: Good evenin', folks.

(SISTERS THOMAS and TAYLOR just grunt. MRS. THOMAS moves a step or two
towards exit. Flirts her skirts and exits.)

LINDSAY: (Angrily) Whut's de matter, y'all? Cat got yo' tongue?

MRS. TAYLOR: More matter than you kin scatter all over Cincinnatti.

LINDSAY: Go 'head on, Lucy Taylor. Go 'head on. You know a very little
of yo' sugar sweetens my coffee. Go 'head on. Everytime you lift yo'
arm you smell like a nest of yellow hammers.

MRS. TAYLOR: Go 'head on yo'self. Yo' head look like it done wore out
three bodies. Talkin' 'bout _me_ smellin'--you smell lak a nest of
grand daddies yo'self.

LINDSAY: Aw rock on down de road, 'oman. Ah, don't wantuh change words
wid yuh. Youse too ugly.

MRS. TAYLOR: You ain't nobody's pretty baby, yo'self. You so ugly I
betcha yo' wife have to spread uh sheet over yo' head tuh let sleep
slip up on yuh.

LINDSAY: (Threatening) You better git way from me while you able. I
done tole you I don't wanter break a breath wid you. It's uh whole
heap better tuh walk off on yo' own legs than it is to be toted off.
I'm tired of yo' achin' round here. You fool wid me now an' I'll knock
you into doll rags, Tony or no Tony.

MRS. TAYLOR: (Jumping up in his face) Hit me? Hit me! I dare you tuh
hit me. If you take dat dare, you'll steal uh hawg an' eat his hair.

LINDSAY: Lemme gwan down to dat church befo' you make me stomp you.
(He exits, right.)

MRS. TAYLOR: You mean you'll _git_ stomped. Ah'm goin' to de trial,
too. De nex trial gointer be _me_ for kickin' some uh you Baptist
niggers around.

(A great noise is heard off stage left. The angry and jeering voices
of children. MRS. TAYLOR looks off left and takes a step or two
towards left exit as the noise comes nearer.)

VOICE OF ONE CHILD: Tell her! Tell her! Turn her up and smell her. Yo'
mama ain't got nothin' to do wid me.

MRS. TAYLOR: (Hollering off left) You lil Baptis' haitians leave them
chillun alone. If you don't, you better!

(Enter about ten children struggling and wrestling in a bunch. MRS.
TAYLOR looks about on the ground for a stick to strike the children
with.)

VOICE OF CHILD: Hey! Hey! He's skeered tuh knock it off. Coward!

MRS. TAYLOR: If y'all don't git on home!

SASSY LITTLE GIRL: (Standing akimbo) I know you better not touch me,
do my mama will 'tend to you.

MRS. TAYLOR: (Making as if to strike her.) Shet up you nasty lil
heifer, sassin' me! You ain't half raised.

(The little girl shakes herself at MRS. TAYLOR and is joined by two or
three others.)

MRS. TAYLOR: (Walkin' towards right exit.) I'm goin' on down to de
church an' tell yo' mammy. But she ain't been half raised herself.
(She exits right with several children making faces behind her.)

ONE BOY: (To sassy GIRL) Aw, haw! Y'all ol' Baptis' ain't got no
bookcase in yo' chuch. We went there one day an' I saw uh soda cracker
box settin' up in de corner so I set down on it. (Pointing at sassy
GIRL) Know what ole Mary Ella say? (Jeering laughter) Willie, you git
up off our library! Haw! Haw!

MARY ELLA: Y'all ole Meth'dis' ain't got no window panes in yo' ole
church.

ANOTHER GIRL: (Takes center of stand, hands akimbo and shakes her
hips) I don't keer whut y'all say, I'm a Meth'dis' bred an' uh
Meth'dis' born an' when I'm dead there'll be uh Meth'dis' gone.

MARY ELLA: (Snaps fingers under other girl's nose and starts singing.
Several join her.)
  Oh Baptis', Baptis' is my name
  My name's written on high
  I got my lick in de Baptis' church
  Gointer eat up de Meth'dis' pie.

(The Methodist children jeer and make faces. The Baptist camp make
faces back; for a full minute there is silence while each camp tries
to outdo the other in face making. The Baptist makes the last face.)

METHODIST BOY: Come on, less us don't notice 'em. Less gwan down to
de church an' hear de trial.

MARY ELLA: Y'all ain't de onliest ones kin go. We goin', too.

WILLIE: Aw, haw! Copy cats! (Makes face) Dat's right. Follow on behind
us lak uh puppy dog tail. (They start walking toward right exit,
switching their clothes behind.) Dat's right. Follow on behind us lak
uh puppy dog tail. (They start walking toward right exit, switching
their clothes behind.)

(Baptist children stage a rush and struggle to get in front of the
Methodists. They finally succeed in flinging some of the Methodist
children to the ground and some behind them and walk towards right
exit haughtily switching their clothes.)

WILLIE: (Whispers to his crowd) Less go round by Mosely's lot an' beat
'em there!

OTHERS: All right!

WILLIE: (Yellin' to Baptists) We wouldn't walk behind no ole Baptists!

(The Methodists turn and walk off towards left exit, switching their
clothes as the Baptists are doing.)

LAWING AND JAWING


by Zora *[Handwritten: (Neale)] Hurston



TIME:          Present

PLACE:         Way cross Georgia

PERSONS:       Judge Dunfumy, Officer Simpson and another, Jemima
               Flapcakes, Cliff Mullins, John Barnes, two lawyers,
               a clerk, a pretty girl and her escort.

SETTING:       Usual court-room arrangement, except that there is a
               large red arrow pointing off-stage left, marked
               "To Jail."

ACTION:        At rise everybody is in place except the Judge.
               Suddenly the CLERK looks off-stage right and motions
               for everybody to rise. Enter the JUDGE. He wears a
               black cap and gown and has his gavel in his hand.
               The two POLICEMEN walk behind him holding up his gown.
               He mounts the bench and glares all about him before he
               seats himself. There is a PRETTY GIRL in the front row
               left, and he takes a good look at her, smiles, frowns
               at her escort. He motions the police to leave him and
               take their places with the spectators and he then raps
               vigorously with his gavel for order.



JUDGE
Hear! Hear! Court is set! My honor is on de bench. You moufy folks set
up!
                             (He glares at the boy with the pretty girl)
All right, Mr. Whistle-britches, just keep up dat jawing now and see
how much time I'll give you!


BOY
I wasn't talking, your honor.


JUDGE
Well, quit looking so moufy.
                             (to CLERK)
Call de first case. And I warn each and all dat my honor is in bad
humor dis mawnin'. I'd give a canary bird twenty years for peckin'
at a elephant.
                             (to CLERK)
Bring 'em on.


CLERK

Cliff Mullins, charged with assault upon his wife with a weapon and
disturbing the peace.
                             (As CLIFF is led to the bar by the
                             officer, the JUDGE glares ferociously
                             at the prisoner. His wife, all
                             bandages, limps up to the bar at the
                             same time.)


JUDGE
So youse one of dese hard-boiled wife-beaters, huh? Just a mean old
woman-Jessie! If I don't lay a hearing on you, God's a gopher! Now what
_made_ you cut such a caper?


CLIFF
Judge, I didn't go hunt her. Saturday night I was down on Dearborn
Street in a nasty ditch *[Handwritten: nasty ditch crossed out in
pencil, (buffet flat)]--


JUDGE
A nasty ditch? *[Handwritten: A nasty ditch crossed out in pencil,
(Buffet flat)]


CLIFF
Aw, at Emma Hayles' house.


JUDGE
Oh, yes. Go on.


CLIFF
Well,
                             (Points thumb at wife)
she come down dere and claim I took her money and she claimed I wuz
spending it on Emma.


CLIFF'S WIFE
And dat's just whut he was doing, too, Judge.


CLIFF
AW, she's tellin' a great big ole Georgia lie, Judge. I wasn't spendin'
no money of her'n.


WOMAN
Yes he was, Judge. There wasn't no money for him to git _but_ mine. He
ain't hit a lick of work since God been to Macon. Know whut he 'lowed
when I worry him 'bout workin'? Says he wouldn't take a job wid de
Careless Love Lumber Company, puttin' out whut make you do me lak you

JUDGE
So, you goes for a sweet-back, do you?


CLIFF
Naw suh, Judge. I'd be glad to work if I could find a job.


JUDGE
How long you been outa work?


CLIFF
Seventeen years--


JUDGE
Seventeen years?
                             (to woman)
You been takin' keer of dis man for seventeen years?


WOMAN
Naw, but he been so mean to me, it seems lak seventeen
years.


JUDGE
Now you tell me just where he hurt you.


WOMAN
Judge, tell you de truth, I'm hurt all over.
                             (Rubs her buttocks)
Fact is I'm cut.


JUDGE
Did you git cut in de fracas?


WOMAN
                             (feeling the back of her left thigh
                             below her buttocks)
Not in de fracas, Judge--just below it.
                             (She starts to show the JUDGE where
                             she has been cut. He motions to stop
                             her.)


JUDGE
Stop!
                              (to Officer Simpson)
Grab him. Put him in de shade.


CLIFF
Judge, I'm unguilty! I ain't laid de weight of my hand on her in malice.
You got me 'cused of murder and I ain't harmed a child.

Lemme ast _you_ something. Didn't you know dat all de women in dis town

                             (CLIFF is led off to jail. JUDGE looks
                             angrily at the boy who is holding
                             hands with the pretty girl)
You runs me hot and I'm just dyin' to sit on _yo'_ case.
Whut you in here for?

Nothin'.


JUDGE
Well, whut you doin' in my court, you gater-faced rascal?


BOY
My girl wanted to see whut was goin' on, so I brought
her in.


JUDGE
Oh yeah!
                             (Smiles at GIRL)
She was usin' good sense to come see whut I'm doin', but how come _you_

You ain't done nothin', hunh? Well den youse guilty of vacancy. Grab

gointer give 'im life-time and eight years mo'.
                             (The OFFICER seizes the boy and frisks
                             him. All he finds is a new deck of
                             cards. The JUDGE looks at them in
                             triumph.)
Unh hunh! I knowed it, one of dese skin game jelly-beans. Robbin' hard
workin' men out they money.


BOY
Judge, I ain't used 'em at all. See, dey's brand new.


JUDGE
Well, den youse charged wid totin' concealed cards and attempt to
gamble. Ten years at hard labor. Put him in de dark, Simpson, and throw
de key away.
                             (He looks at the girl and beams.)
Don't you worry bout how you gointer git home. You gointer be took home
right, 'cause I'm gointer take you myself. Bring on de next one, clerk.


CLERK
Jemima Flap-Cakes, charged with illegal possession and sale of alcoholic
liquors.


JUDGE
                             (She is a fat, black, belligerent
                             looking woman. JUDGE looks coldly at
                             her.)
Well, you heard whut he said. Is you guilty or unguilty? And I'm tellin'
you right now dat you come up befo' _me_ it's just like youse in church.
You better have a strong determination, and you better tell a good
experience.


JEMIMA
                             (Arms akimbo)
Yes, I sold it and I'll sell it again.
                             (snaps fingers and shakes hips)
How does ole booze-selling mama talk?


JUDGE
Yes, five thousand dollars and ten years in jail.
                             (Snaps fingers and shakes hips)
How does ole heavy fining papa talk?
                             (She is led away, shouting and
                             weeping)


CLERK
De Otis Blunt, charged wid stealin' a mule.
                             (LAWYER arises and comes forward with
                             the prisoner)


LAWYER
You can't convict this man. I'm here to represent him.


JUDGE
Yo' mouf might spout lak a coffee pot but I got a lawyer
                             (Looks at other lawyer)
dat kin beat your segastuatin'.
                             (Looks admiring at girl)
How am I chewin' my dictionary and minglin' my alphabets?


LAWYER
Well, I kin try, can't I?


JUDGE
Oh yeah, you kin try, but I kin see right now where he's gointer git all
de time dat God ever made dat ain't been used already. From now on.
                             (To LAWYER)
Go 'head, and spread yo' lungs all over Georgy, but he's goin' to jail!
Mules _must_ be respected.


LAWYER
                             (Striking a pose at the bar)
Your Honor,

Ladies and Gentlemen--


JUDGE
Never mind 'bout dat lady. You talk yo' chat to _me_.


LAWYER
This is a clear case of syllogism! Again I say syllogism. My client is
innocent because it was a dark night when they say he stole the mule and
that's against all laws of syllogism.
                             (JUDGE looks impressed and laughs)


JUDGE
Dat ole fool do know somethin' 'bout law.


LAWYER
When George Washington was pleading de case of Marbury vs. Madison, what
did _he_ say? What _did_ he say? Scintillate, scintillate, Globule
orific. Fain would I fathom thy nature's specific. Loftily poised in
ether capacious, strongly resembling a gem carbonacious. What did
Abraham Lincoln say about mule-stealing? When torrid Phoebut refuses his
presence and ceases to lamp with fierce incandescence, then you illumine
the regions supernal, scintillate, scintillate, semper noctornal.
Syllogism, again I say syllogism.
                             (He takes his seat amid applause)


JUDGE
Man, youse a pleadin' fool. You knows yo' rules and by-laws.


OTHER LAWYER
Let me show my glory. Let me spread my habeas corpus.


JUDGE
'Tain't no use. Dis lawyer done convinced me.


OTHER LAWYER
But, lemme parade my material--


JUDGE
Parade yo' material anywhere you wants to exceptin' befo' me. Dis lil
girl wants to go home and I'm goin' with her and enjoy de consequences.

                              popular concept of Negro life)



TIME:      Present

PLACE:     Washington, D.C.

SCENE:     The Ball Park

PERSONS:   The Howard and Lincoln teams, the Howard band, cheer
           leaders, spectators.

SETTING:   The park with grandstands on either sides and up-stage.

ACTION:    At rise, the grandstands are full, the cheer leaders
           are violently gyrating to whip up the mob. The
           Lincoln colors fly from the right. The Howard from the
           left. Both have cheer leaders. First is heard the
           Lincoln mob singing "DIDN'T HE RAMBLE, RAMBLE."


Lincoln Mob

    And didn't he ramble, ramble, ramble all around, in and out of town
    He rambled, he rambled, rambled till Ol' Lincoln cut him down


Howard Mob

    There'll be nothing but sweetmeats, for our football team
    There'll be nothing but sweetmeats for our football team
    Baked Hampton, boiled Shaw, fried Union, Lincoln Slaw,
    There'll be nothing but sweetmeats, for our football team.

                              (Enter the HOWARD BAND, led by a
                              hot-strutting drum major. They parade
                              the field and the men students pile
                              down and fall in behind the team.
                              They sing and shout to the TEAM
                              SONG:)

    This is the t-e-a-m team
    On which the hopes of Howard lean
    Beat Ol' Hampton, beat Ol' Union
    Sweep Ol' Lincoln clean

    We are the b-e-s-t best
    Of the r-e-s-t rest
    Come and watch us put Ol' Howard
    On top of Lincoln's chest.

    We'll hit the l-i-n-e line
    For a hundred ninety-nine
    For we love Ol' Howard, yes we love her
    All the t-i-m-e time.

                              (At the conclusion the teams takes
                              the field. The ball is put into play
                              and LINCOLN kicks off to Howard. As
                              the ball is caught and when the
                              player who is carrying the ball
                              plunges, followed by his team, the
                              Lincoln players fall on their knees
                              and begin to sing I COULDN'T HEAR
                              NOBODY PRAY. The HOWARD team charges
                              down shouting Joshua fit de battle of
                              Jericho. Whenever a player is tackled
                              there is a duet of dancing. Every
                              step is a dance. Finally the
                              grandstand catches fire and the
                              dancing and the shouting runs riot up
                              there. When the ball is on Lincoln's
                              ten-yard line, they hold Howard there
                              by rounding up both teams into a
                              huddle and the bunch-shout and sing
                              to a QUICK CURTAIN.)

CURTAIN


LINCOLN'S PRAYER:

    Ah, ah, they shall not ah pass us

    They shall not pass us, Ah-h-h-h.

          the shacks a WOMAN is discovered
          ironing. A MAN is sitting on the
          floor of the porch asleep.  She
          hums a bar or two, then comes to
          the window and calls to the man.



Woman
Good Black, why don't you git up from dere and carry dese white folks
clothes home? You always want money but you wouldn't hit a lick at a
snake!

Man
Aw, shut up woman. I'm tired of hearin' bout dem white folks clothes. I
don't keer if dey never git 'em.

Woman
You better keer! Dese very clothes took and brought _you_ out de crack.
'Cause de first time I saw you you was so hungry till you was walkin'
lap-legged. Man, you had de white-mouf, you was so hungry.

                             (Enter another MAN leisurely. Good
                             Black sees him and calls)

Good Black
Hey, Cliffert, where you headed for?

Cliffert
Oh, no where in particular.

Good Black
Come here then, fish, and lemme bend a checker game over yo' head. Come
on, youse my fish.

Cliffert
                             (Comes to the porch and sits)
Git de checkers and I'll have you any, some or none. I push a mean
chuck-a-luck myself.

Woman
                             (Voice inside quarreling)
Dress up and strut around! Yes! Play checkers? Yes! Eat? Yes! Work? No!!

                             (The game starts. A period of silence
                             in which they indicate their
                             concentration by frowns, cautious
                             moves, head scratching. GOOD BLACK is
                             pointing his index finger over the
                             board indicating moves. He wig-wags,
                             starts to move, scratches his head
                             thoroughly, changes his mind and fools
                             around without moving)

Cliffert
Police! Police! Come here and make dis man move!

Good Black
Aw, I got plenty moves.
                             (Scratches his head)
Jus' tryin' to see which one I want to make. But when I do move, it's
gointer be just too bad for you.

                             (A guitar is heard off stage and
                             Cliffert brightens. He cups his hand
                             and calls)

Cliffert
Hey Lonnie! Come here! Ha, ha, ha! I got me a fish.
                             (Enter LONNIE picking "East Coast" on
                             his box and stands watching the game.
                             He ceases to play as he stops walking)
Ha, ha! You see ol' Good Black goes for a hard guy. He tries to know
more than a mule and a mule's head longer'n his'n. Ha, ha! I set a trap
for him and he fell right in it. Trying to ride de britches! _Now_ look
at him.

Good Black
Aw, shut up! You tryin' to show yo' grandma how to milk ducks. You can't
beat me playin' no checkers.
                             (Scratches his head again)
Just watch me show my glory.

Woman
                             (Leans out of window)
Good Black! When you gointer come git dese clothes!
                             (He does not answer, he is trying to
                             concentrate)

Lonnie
You got him Cliffert. You got him in Louisville Loop. He's yo' fish all
right.

Cliffert
                             (Boastfully)
Man, didn't I push a mean chuck-a-luck dat time! I'm good, better, and
best. Move, Man!
                             (To Good Black)
I tole you not to do it.

Good Black
All dat noise ain't playin' checkers. You just wait till I make my move.

Woman
All right, now, Mr. Nappy-Chin! I don't want to have to call you no mo'
to come keer dese white folks clothes! I'm tired of takin' and takin'
affa you! My belly's full clear up to de neck. I don't need no lazy coon
lak you nohow. I'm a good woman, and I needs somebody dats gointer give
aid and assistance.

Good Black,
Aw, go head on', woman, and leave me be! Every Saturday it's de same
thing! Yo' mouth exhausting like a automobile. You worse than "cryin'
Emma". You kin whoop like de Seaboard and squall lak de Coast Line.
                             (Taps his head)
You ain't go all dat b'long to _you_, and nothin' dat b'long to nobody's
else. You better leave me 'lone before you make a bad man out of me.
Fool wid me and I'll go git me somebody else. I'm a much-right man.

Woman
Now you ain't no much right man neither. You didn't _git me_ wid no
saw-mill license--You went to de court house and paid a dollar and a
half for me. Tain't no other woman got as much right to you as I got. De
Man to tell you youse divorced befo' yo' kin play dat much-right on me!

Good Black
De Man don't have to tell me nothin'! I got divorce in my heels.

Woman
You ain't de only one dat knows where de railroad track is, I done made
up my mind, and I done promised Gabriel and a couple of other men dat
if yo' don't do no better than yo' been doin', I'm gointer pack me a
suit case and grab de first smoky thing I see. I'll be long gone.

Good Black
Aw, yo' ain't no trouble! Yo' can be had. Yo' ain't never gointer
leave me.

Woman
How come I won't? Just 'cause I been takin' keer of yo', don't make a
park ape out yo'self. I'll leave yo', just as sure as yo' snore!

Good Black
                             (Rises and hitches up his trousers)
Aw, yo' ain't gointer leave me, and if yo' go, yo' wouldn't stay, 'cause
I'm a damn sweet man, and yo' know it!

Lonnie
Hey, Hey!
                             (He begins to pick and Good Black
                             sings. Lonnie sings a line now and
                             then)

Good Black
  Yo' may leave and go to Hali-muh-fack
  But my slow drag will--uh bring yo' back
  Well yo' may go, but this will bring yo' back

  I been in de country but I moved to town
  I'm a tolo-shaker from my head on down
  Well, yo' may go, but this will bring yo' back

  Some folks call me a tolo-shaker
  It's a doggone lie I'm a back-bone breaker
  Well, yo' may go, but this will bring yo' back.

  Oh, ship on de sea, boat on de ocean
  I raise hell when I take a notion
  Well, yo' may go, but this will bring yo' back.

  Oh, who do, who do, who do wackin'
  Wid my hells a' poppin' and my toe-nails crackin'
  Well, yo' may go, but this will bring yo' back.

Woman
Dat's all right too, pap but if yo' can't make me tote dese clothes
home, don't bring de mess up. Yo'se abstifically a humbug.

Cliffert
Man, come on back here and move, or else own up to de folks yo' can't
push no checkers wid me.
                             (He sits and begins to lay out moves
                             with his fingers and scratch his head.
                             Enter another MAN and stands akimbo
                             looking over Cliff's shoulder)

Cliff
                             (Looking up)
Don't stand over me lak dat, ugly as yo' is.

Man (Skanko)
You ain't nobody's pretty baby yo'self!

Cliff
Dat's all right, I ain't as ugly as yo'--youse ugly enough to git behind
a Simpoon weed and hatch monkies.

Man (Skanko)
And youse ugly enough to git behind a tombstone and hatch hants.

Cliff
Youse so ugly dey have to cover yo' face up at night so sleep can slip
up on yo'.

Man (Skanko)
You look like ten cents worth of Have-Mercy. Yo' face look lak ole Uncle
Jump-off. Yo' mouth look lak a bunch of ruffles.

Cliff
Yeah, but yo' done passed me. Yo' so ugly till they could throw yo' in
de Mississippi River and skim ugly for six months.

Man (Skanko)
Look here, Cliff, don't yo' personate me! Counting from de little finger
back to de thumb--yo' start anythin', I go yo' some.

Cliff
Go head and grab me buddie, but if yo' don't know how to turn me loose
too, don't bring de mess up! If yo' hit me, I may not beat you, but
yo'll be so dirty when St. Peter git yo' dat he can't use yo'.

Man (Skanko)
Don't call _me_ buddy. Yo' buddy is huntin' coconuts. Don't yo' try to
throw me for a nap. Do. I'll kill yo' so stiff dead they'll have to push
yo' down. Yo' gointer to make me do some double cussin' on you.
                             (He picks up a heavy stick and walks
                             back towards Cliff)
Now I got dis farmer's choice in my hands, yo' better git outa my face.

Cliff
Yo' wanta fight?

Man
Yeah I wanta fight. Put it where I kin use it and I'll sho' use it. I'll
fight anybody. I get so hot sometimes I fights de corner of de house.
I'm so hot I totes a pistol to keep from gettin' in a fight wid myself.
I prints dangerous every time I sit down in, in a chair.

Cliff
Man, this ain't no fighting weather. Ha, ha, ha! Did yo' think I was mad
sho' nuff? Yo' can't fight me. They's got to be runnin' before fightin'
and they's got to be plenty _good_ runnin' before dis fight comes off.

Man
All right now. Yo' leave me alone and I'm a _good_ man. I'm just like an
old shoe. If yo' rain on me and cool me off I'm soft! If yo' shine on me
and git me hot, I'm hard.
                             (He drops the stick and exits)

                             (Cliff is shaking all over. He looks
                             after the Man to be sure he is gone)

Good Black
Kah, kah, kah. Whut yo' so scarred about? De way yo' was talkin' I
though yo' was mad enough to fight.

Cliff
I was. I gits hot real quick! But I'm very easy cooled when de man I'm
mad wid is bigger'n me.
                             (He drops into his seat, wiping his
                             face)
Man did yo' see how he grabbed up dat check? He done skeered me into a
three-week's spasm!

Good Black's Wife

                             happily across without stopping. Good
                             Black pretends to cough)

Good Black

                             (Gets up and approaches her
                             flirtatiously)
I didn't quite git yo' name straight. Yo' better tell it to me again.

                             (The girl exits and he resumes his
                             seat)

Cliff
Come on, Good Black, lemme wrap dis checker roun yo' neck.

Good Black
Gimme time, gimme time! Don't try to rush me.
                             (He begins same business of figuring
                             out moves and scratching his head)

                             (Enter two or three girls and fellows.
                             The girls are dressed in cool summer
                             dresses, but nothing elaborate)

Lonnie
I know I'm gointer play something now.
                             (He tunes and plays "Cold Rainy Day".
                             He begins to sing and the others join
                             in. Not all. But all start to dancing.
                             They couple off as far as possible and
                             Lindy. The men unmated do hot solo
                             steps. The men cry out in ecstacy)

1. Shimmy! If you can't shimmy, shake your head.

2. Look, baby, look! Throw it in de alley

3. Look, if you can't look, stick out, and if you can't stick
out, git out.
                             (At the end of the son and dance, one
                             of the girls exclaim)

Girl
Aw, we got to go. Mama's looking for us.
                             (The three girls exit, walking
                             happily. The men watch them go)

Cliff
Oh boy, look at 'em! Switching it and looking back at it.
                             (He imitates the girl's walk)

Good Black
Yeah Lawd, ain't they specifyin'! They handles a lot of traffic.

Cliff
                             (Seating himself again)
Yeah, but dat don't play no checkers. Come on here, Good Black
and lemme finish wearing your ant.

Good Black's Wife

Good Black
Yeah and if she don't git, she keep right on whoopin'. B'lieve
I wants a drink of water. Wisht I knowed where I could slip
up on me a drink.

Cliff
Aw man, come on back here and move. Yo' doin' everythin' but playin'
checkers. You'd ruther move a mountain wid a pry bar than to move
                             (Points)
dat man.

Good Black
                             (Seats himself)
Lemme hurry up and beat dis game befo' yo' bust yo' britches.
                             (He wags his finger to indicate moves,
                             scratches his head, but doesn't move.
                             Several men enter and group around the
                             players. All offer suggestions. One
                             says, "you got him Cliffert. He's
                             locked up just as tight as a keyhole".
                             Another: "Aw, man he kin break out!"
                             Another: "Yeah, but it'll cost him
                             plenty to git out of dat trap".)

Cliff
Police! Police! He won't move!

Another Voice
Aw, leave go de checkers and less shoot some crap.

                             (Enter a WOMAN in a house dress, head
                             rag on, run down house shoes. She goes
                             to the edge of the porch and calls
                             inside)

Woman
Him there Bertha, what yo' doin'.

Woman Inside
Still bumpin' de white folks clothes--hittin' for de sundown man. Come
on in and have some sit down.

Outside Woman
Ain't got time. Got a house full of company. I took a minute to see if
yo' could let me have a little skeeting garret.

Inside Woman
How come yo' didn't git yo'self some snuff whilst yo' was at de store?
De man ast yo' what else. I ain't no Piggly Wiggly. Reckon I kin spare
yo' a dip tho.
                             (She hands out the box and the outside
                             woman fills her lip and hands it back)

Outside Woman
Much obliged, I thank yo'. Reckon I better heel and toe it on back, to
see how de comp'ny is makin' out.

Inside Woman
Step inside a minute I want to put a bug in yo' ear.
                             (She makes an urgent gesture and the
                             other woman goes inside)

                             (Lonnie is sitting off to himself and
                             picking "Rabbit on de Log" softly. A
                             small BOY dashes on with a lolly pop
                             in his hand. He is licking it and
                             laughing. He is pursued by a little
                             GIRL yelling "you gimme my all day
                             sucker! Johnny! You gimme my candy,
                             now!" They run all over the stage. The
                             men take notice of them and one of
                             them seizes the boy and restores the
                             candy to the girl. She pokes out her
                             tongue at the boy and says "goody,
                             goody, goody, goody, goody!" She notes
                             the guitar playing and begins to
                             dance. The boy makes faces back at her
                             and dances back at her. The music gets
                             louder, dancing faster, check board
                             gets upset. General laughter at that.
                             When dance is over, boy snatches the
                             lolly pop again and races away and the
                             girl runs behind him yelling "Johnny!
                             You gimme my candy! Johnny!" The music
                             stops and the crap game gets under
                             way. Furious side bets for 5 and 10
                             cents each. Loud calls on Miss "Daisy
                             Dice", snake eyes, "Ada from Decatur".
                             Somebody suggests a soft roll, others
                             object on the ground that it's too
                             easy for the experts to cheat)

Good Black
Gimme de dice! I'm gointer play 'em like John Henry.

Lonnie
John Henry didn't bother wid de bones. He used to play Georgy Skin.

Good Black
He shot crap too. He played everythin' and everythin' he played, he
played it good. Just like he uster drive steel. If I could whip steel
like John Henry, I wouldn't stay here and nowhere else.

Cliff
Whut would yo' do?

Good Black
I'd go somewhere and keep books for somebody.

Lonnie
I know how to play John Henry.

Good Black
Well, turn it on and let de bad luck happen.
                             (As Lonnie plays thru a verse warming
                             up, all the men get interested and
                             start to hum. Cliffert shouts out)

Cliff
Lawd, Lawd, what evil have I done)
                             (They sing John Henry. At the close,
                             the woman who came to borrow snuff
                             emerges from the house still talking
                             back at the woman inside)

Woman
He ain't no trouble. I tole him, I says, "yo' must think youse de man
dat made side meat taste lak ham." See yo' later.
                             (She exits hurriedly. The crap game
                             goes on until a band is heard
                             approaching)

Lonnie
Who dead?

Cliff
Nobody. Don't you know de Imperial Elks is goin' to New York to de Elks
Grand Lodge? Yeah, bo, and they's takin' they band. Dat's supposed to be
de _finest_ band in de United States.
                             (The band approaches followed by a
                             great crow. The crap game is instantly
                             deserted and all follow the band)
